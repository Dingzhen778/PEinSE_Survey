In this work, weconduct the first systematic study on the SE factual knowledge in thestate-of-the-art PCM CoPilot, focusing on APIs' Fully Qualified Names (FQNs),the fundamental knowledge for effective code analysis, search and reuse. Drivenby FQNs' data distribution properties, we design a novel lightweight in-contextlearning on Copilot for FQN inference, which does not require code compilationas traditional methods or gradient update by recent FQN prompt-tuning. Wesystematically experiment with five in-context-learning design factors toidentify the best in-context learning configuration that developers can adoptin practice. With this best configuration, we investigate the effects of amountof example prompts and FQN data properties on Copilot's FQN inferencecapability. Our results confirm that Copilot stores diverse FQN knowledge andcan be applied for the FQN inference due to its high inference accuracy andnon-reliance on code analysis.

Code LLMs with more than millions ofparameters are trained on a massive amount of code in different ProgrammingLanguages (PLs). Such models are used for automating various SoftwareEngineering (SE) tasks using prompt engineering. However, given the very largesize of industry-scale project files, a major issue of these LLMs is theirlimited context window size, motivating the question of ""Can these LLMs processvery large files and can we effectively perform prompt engineering?"". Codetranslation aims to convert source code from one PL to another. In this work,we assess the effect of method-level program decomposition on context window ofLLMs and investigate how this approach can enable translation of very largefiles which originally could not be done due to out-of-context issue. Ourobservations from 20 well-known java projects and approximately 60K methodssuggest that method-level program decomposition significantly improves thelimited context window problem of LLMs by 99.5%. Furthermore, our empiricalanalysis indicate that with method-level decomposition, each input fragment onaverage only consumes 5% of the context window, leaving more context space forprompt engineering and the output. Finally, we investigate the effectiveness ofa Call Graph (CG) approach for translating very large files when doingmethod-level program decomposition.",Ali Reza Ibrahimzada,2024/1/22,2024/1/22

Although a number of studies have shown that LLMs have beeneffectively evaluated on popular accuracy metrics (e.g., BLEU, CodeBleu),previous research has largely overlooked the role of Causal Inference as afundamental component of the interpretability of LLMs' performance. Existingbenchmarks and datasets are meant to highlight the difference between theexpected and the generated outcome, but do not take into account confoundingvariables (e.g., lines of code, prompt size) that equally influence theaccuracy metrics. The fact remains that, when dealing with generative softwaretasks by LLMs, no benchmark is available to tell researchers how to quantifyneither the causal effect of SE-based treatments nor the correlation ofconfounders to the model's performance. In an effort to bring statistical rigorto the evaluation of LLMs, this paper introduces a benchmarking strategy namedGaleras comprised of curated testbeds for three SE tasks (i.e., codecompletion, code summarization, and commit generation) to help aid theinterpretation of LLMs' performance. We illustrate the insights of ourbenchmarking strategy by conducting a case study on the performance of ChatGPTunder distinct prompt engineering methods. The results of the case studydemonstrate the positive causal influence of prompt semantics on ChatGPT'sgenerative performance by an average treatment effect of $\approx 3\%$.Moreover, it was found that confounders such as prompt size are highlycorrelated with accuracy metrics ($\approx 0.412\%$). The end result of ourcase study is to showcase causal inference evaluations, in practice, to reduceconfounding bias.

Our quantitative analysis of theseprompting strategies suggests that prompt engineering GPT-4 cannot necessarilyand significantly outperform fine-tuning smaller/older LLMs in all three tasks.For comment generation, GPT-4 with the best prompting strategy (i.e.,task-specific prompt) had outperformed the first-ranked fine-tuned model by8.33% points on average in BLEU.

Nevertheless, instructing the model to break downthe problem into smaller reasoning steps (Wei et al., 2022), or ensemblingvarious generations through modifying decoding steps (Wang et al., 2023) boostsperformance. Current methods assume that the input prompt is fixed and expectthe decoding strategies to introduce the diversity needed for ensembling. Inthis work, we relax this assumption and discuss how one can create and leveragevariations of the input prompt as a means to diversity of thought to improvemodel performance. We propose a method that automatically improves promptdiversity by soliciting feedback from the LLM to ideate approaches that fit forthe problem. We then ensemble the diverse prompts in our method DIV-SE (DIVersereasoning path Self-Ensemble) across multiple inference calls. We also proposea cost-effective alternative where diverse prompts are used within a singleinference call; we call this IDIV-SE (In-call DIVerse reasoning pathSelf-Ensemble).

Consequently, an additional alignment phase istypically employed, wherein the model is further trained with human preferencedata to better align its outputs with human expectations. While this processdoesn't introduce new capabilities per se, it does accentuate generation stylesinnate to the model. This paper explores the utilization of counterfactualprompting within the framework of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to alignthe model's style without relying on human intervention. We demonstrate thatthis method effectively instils desirable behaviour, mitigates undesirableones, and encourages the model to disregard inappropriate instructions. Ourfindings suggest that counterfactual prompting with DPO presents a low-resourceway to fine-tune LLMs to meet the demands for responsible and ethically alignedAI systems.",Bradley Butcher,2024/1/17,2024/1/19

However, the reconstructed 3D objects usingstate-of-the-art image-to-3D methods still exhibit low correspondence to thegiven image and low multi-view consistency. Recent state-of-the-art text-to-3Dmethods are also limited, yielding 3D samples with low diversity per promptwith long synthesis time. To address these challenges, we propose DITTO-NeRF, anovel pipeline to generate a high-quality 3D NeRF model from a text prompt or asingle image. Our DITTO-NeRF consists of constructing high-quality partial 3Dobject for limited in-boundary (IB) angles using the given or text-generated 2Dimage from the frontal view and then iteratively reconstructing the remaining3D NeRF using inpainting latent diffusion model. We propose progressive 3Dobject reconstruction schemes in terms of scales (low to high resolution),angles (IB angles initially to outer-boundary (OB) later), and masks (object tobackground boundary) in our DITTO-NeRF so that high-quality information on IBcan be propagated into OB.

Thecalculations are performed for Zinc Blende (ZB) structure for 12 values of thelattice parameter between 5.44 and 6.62 \AA, appropriate for some typical II-VIand III-V semiconducting substrates. Electronic structure is calculated via thelinear muffin-tin-orbitals (LMTO) method in the atomic sphere approximation(ASA), using empty spheres to optimize ASA-related errors. Whenever necessary,the results have been verified using the full-potential version of the method,FP-LMTO. The disorder effect in the As-sublattice for CrAs$_{50}$X$_{50}$(X=Sb, S, Se, Te) alloys is taken into account via the coherent potentialapproximation (CPA). Exchange interactions are calculated using the linearresponse method for the ferromagnetic (FM) reference states of the alloys, aswell as the disordered local moments (DLM) states. These results are then usedto estimate the Curie temperature from the low and high temperature side of theferromagnetic/paramagnetic transition. Estimates of the Curie temperature areprovided, based on the mean field and the more accurate random phaseapproximations. Dominant antiferromagnetic exchange interactions for some lowvalues of the lattice parameter for the FM reference states in CrS, CrSe andCrTe prompted us to look for antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations for thesesystems with energies lower than the corresponding FM and DLM values.

The calculationsare based on density-functional theory in the local density approximation andon the pseudopotential plane-wave method. The reliability of the simulations isconfirmed by detailed comparisons with very recent neutron diffraction resultsfor the partial structure factors and radial distribution functions (RDF) ofthe stoichiometric liquid Ag2Se. The simulations show a dramatic change of theSe-Se RDF with increasing Se content. This change is due to the formation of Seclusters bound by covalent bonds, the Se-Se bond length being almost the sameas in pure c-Se and l-Se. The clusters are predominantly chain-like, but forhigher x a large fraction of 3-fold coordinated Se atoms is also found. It isshown that the equilibrium fractions of Se present as isolated atoms and inclusters can be understood on a simple charge-balance model based on an ionicinterpretation. The Ag and Se diffusion coefficients both increase with Secontent, in spite of the Se clustering. An analysis of the Se-Se bond dynamicsreveals surprisingly short bond lifetimes of less than 1 ps. The changes in thedensity of states with composition arise directly from the formation of Se-Secovalent bonds. Results for the electronic conductivity obtained using theKubo-Greenwood approximation are in adequate agreement with experiment forl-Ag2Se, but not for the high Se contents.

Previously explored ways to achieve Pb-free halideperovskites involved replacing Pb$^{2+}$ with other similar M$^{2+}$ cations inns$^2$ electron configuration, e.g., Sn$^{2+}$ or by Bi$^{3+}$ (plus Ag$^+$),but unfortunately this showed either poor stability (M = Sn) or weaklyabsorbing oversized indirect gaps (M = Bi), prompting concerns that perhapsstability and good optoelectronic properties might be contraindicated. Herein,we exploit the electronic structure underpinning of classic Cu[In,Ga]Se$_{2}$(CIGS) chalcopyrite solar absorbers to design Pb-free halide perovskites bytransmuting 2Pb to the pair [B$^{IB}$ + C$^{III}$]. The resulting group ofdouble perovskites with formula A$_2$BCX$_6$ (A = K, Rb, Cs; B = Cu, Ag; C =Ga, In; X = Cl, Br, I) benefits from the ionic, yet narrow-gap character ofhalide perovskites, and at the same time borrows the advantage of the strongand rapidly rising Cu(d)/Se(p) $\rightarrow$ Ga/In(s/p)valence-to-conduction-band absorption spectra known from CIGS.

Methods: A new network architecture called SAR-U-Net was designed. Firstly,the SE block is introduced to adaptively extract image features after eachconvolution in the U-Net encoder, while suppressing irrelevant regions, andhighlighting features of specific segmentation task; Secondly, ASPP wasemployed to replace the transition layer and the output layer, and acquiremulti-scale image information via different receptive fields. Thirdly, toalleviate the degradation problem, the traditional convolution block wasreplaced with the residual block and thus prompt the network to gain accuracyfrom considerably increased depth.

Our approach is motivated by a recent theoretical result that linksbetween the minimum MSE (MMSE) predictor and the predictor that minimizes theMSE under a perfect perceptual quality constraint. Specifically, it has beenshown that the latter can be obtained by optimally transporting the output ofthe former, such that its distribution matches the source data. Thus, toimprove the perceptual quality of a predictor that was originally trained tominimize MSE, we approximate the optimal transport by a linear transformationin the latent space of a variational auto-encoder, which we compute inclosed-form using empirical means and covariances. Going beyond the theory, wefind that applying the same procedure on models that were initially trained toachieve high perceptual quality, typically improves their perceptual qualityeven further.

The training process was conducted in three steps, eventually leading to amodel with over 95% agreement with the classical SES. Visualization of testedmolecular surfaces shows that the machine-learned SES overlaps with theclassical SES on almost all situations. We also implemented the machine-learnedSES into the Amber/PBSA program to study its performance on reaction fieldenergy calculation.

In this paper, we propose a Linear Programming(LP) Contractor algorithm that uses a relative distance measure (RDM) intervaloperation to solve this problem. In the proposed model, measurement errors areassumed to be bounded into given sets, thus converting the state variables toRDM variables. In this case, the SE model is a non-convex model, and thesolution credibility cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, each nonlinearmeasurement equation in the model is transformed into dual inequality linearequations using the mean value theorem.

We explore techniques for exploiting the capacity ofnarratives and cultural anchors to encode nuanced intentions and techniques forencouraging deconstruction of a problem into components before producing averdict. Informed by this more encompassing theory of prompt programming, wealso introduce the idea of a metaprompt that seeds the model to generate itsown natural language prompts for a range of tasks.

A common form of linear objectives to be maximized in this arealeads to the concept of score equivalence (SE), both for linear objectives andfor faces of the family-variable polytope. We characterize the linear space ofSE objectives and establish a one-to-one correspondence between SE faces of thefamily-variable polytope, the faces of the characteristic-imset polytope, andstandardized supermodular functions. The characterization of SE facets in termsof extremality of the corresponding supermodular function gives an elegantmethod to verify whether an inequality is SE-facet-defining for thefamily-variable polytope. We also show that when maximizing an SE objective onecan eliminate linear constraints of the family-variable polytope thatcorrespond to non-SE facets. However, we show that solely considering SE facetsis not enough as a counter-example shows; one has to consider the linearinequality constraints that correspond to facets of the characteristic-imsetpolytope despite the fact that they may not define facets in thefamily-variable mode.",James Cussens,2015/3/3,2015/4/10

Task-level prompting methodslearn one universal prompt for all input samples, which is efficient butineffective to capture subtle differences among different classes.Instance-level prompting methods learn a specific prompt for each input, thougheffective but inefficient. In this work, we develop a novel prototype-basedprompt learning method to overcome the above limitations. In particular, wefocus on few-shot image recognition tasks on pretrained vision-language models(PVLMs) and develop a method of prompting through prototype (PTP), where wedefine $K$ image prototypes and $K$ prompt prototypes. In PTP, the imageprototype represents a centroid of a certain image cluster in the latent spaceand a prompt prototype is defined as a soft prompt in the continuous space. Thesimilarity between a query image and an image prototype determines how muchthis prediction relies on the corresponding prompt prototype. Hence, in PTP,similar images will utilize similar prompting ways.

Most of the currently available feature-selection methodsreturn only a single subset of features, supposedly the one with the highestpredictive power. We argue that in several domains multiple subsets can achieveclose to maximal predictive accuracy, and that arbitrarily providing only onehas several drawbacks. The SES method attempts to identify multiple, predictivefeature subsets whose performances are statistically equivalent. Under thatrespect SES subsumes and extends previous feature selection algorithms, likethe max-min parent children algorithm. SES is implemented in an homonymfunction included in the R package MXM, standing for mens ex machina, meaning'mind from the machine' in Latin. The MXM implementation of SES handles severaldata-analysis tasks, namely classification, regression and survival analysis.In this paper we present the SES algorithm, its implementation, and provideexamples of use of the SES function in R. Furthermore, we analyze threepublicly available data sets to illustrate the equivalence of the signaturesretrieved by SES and to contrast SES against the state-of-the-art featureselection method LASSO.

Depositing Mn metal onBi$_2$Se$_3$ without an external source of Se shows unexpected bonding withinthe Mn layer due to Mn-Se bonding as Se diffuses out of the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ layerinto the growing Mn film.

A general circuit power model isconsidered. For all the three channel cases, the tradeoff between the EE and SEis studied. It is shown that the EE improves strictly as the SE increases from0 to the optimum SE, and then strictly degrades as the SE increases beyond theoptimum SE. The impact of {\kappa}, {\rho} and other system parameters on theoptimum EE and corresponding SE is investigated to obtain insight.Some of theimportant and interesting results for all the channel cases include: (1) when{\kappa} increases the SE corresponding to the optimum EE should keep unchangedif {\phi}(R) = R, but reduced if {\phi}(R) is strictly convex of R; (2) whenthe rate-independent circuit power {\rho} increases, the SE corresponding tothe optimum EE has to be increased.

This noise can result indegradation of the SEM image quality for a given imaging dose. SE countimaging, which uses the direct count of SEs detected from the sample instead ofthe average signal intensity, would overcome this limitation and lead toimprovement in SEM image quality.

Technical routes for the DM-based SEmethods can be summarized into three types: task-adapted diffusion processformulation, generator-plus-conditioner (GPC) structures and the multi-stageframeworks. We focus on the first two approaches, which are constructed underthe GPC architecture and use the task-adapted diffusion process to better dealwith the real noise. However, the performance of these SE models is limited bythe following issues: (a) Non-Gaussian noise estimation in the task-adapteddiffusion process. (b) Conditional domain bias caused by the weak conditionerdesign in the GPC structure. (c) Large amount of residual noise caused byunreasonable interpolation operations during inference. To solve the aboveproblems, we propose a noise-aware diffusion-based SE model (NADiffuSE) toboost the SE performance, where the noise representation is extracted from thenoisy speech signal and introduced as a global conditional information forestimating the non-Gaussian components. Furthermore, the anchor-based inferencealgorithm is employed to achieve a compromise between the speech distortion andnoise residual.

However, it has also raised concerns regarding the privacyof sensitive data stored in the cloud. To address these concerns, encryptiontechniques have been widely used. However, traditional encryption schemes limitthe efficient search and retrieval of encrypted data. To tackle this challenge,innovative approaches have emerged, such as the utilisation of HomomorphicEncryption (HE) in Searchable Encryption (SE) schemes. This paper provides acomprehensive analysis of the advancements in HE-based privacy-preservingtechniques, focusing on their application in SE. The main contributions of thiswork include the identification and classification of existing SE schemes thatutilize HE, a comprehensive analysis of the types of HE used in SE, anexamination of how HE shapes the search process structure and enablesadditional functionalities, and the identification of promising directions forfuture research in HE-based SE. The findings reveal the increasing usage of HEin SE schemes, particularly Partially Homomorphic Encryption. The analysis alsohighlights the prevalence of index-based SE schemes using HE, the support forranked search and multi-keyword queries, and the need for further explorationin functionalities such as verifiability and the ability to authorise andrevoke users.

2305.13547v3,Self-Evolution Learning for Mixup: Enhance Data Augmentation on Few-Shot Text Classification Tasks,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13547v3,"Text classification tasks often encounter few shot scenarios with limitedlabeled data, and addressing data scarcity is crucial. Data augmentation withmixup has shown to be effective on various text classification tasks. However,most of the mixup methods do not consider the varying degree of learningdifficulty in different stages of training and generate new samples with onehot labels, resulting in the model over confidence. In this paper, we propose aself evolution learning (SE) based mixup approach for data augmentation in textclassification, which can generate more adaptive and model friendly pesudosamples for the model training. SE focuses on the variation of the model'slearning ability. To alleviate the model confidence, we introduce a novelinstance specific label smoothing approach, which linearly interpolates themodel's output and one hot labels of the original samples to generate new softfor label mixing up. Through experimental analysis, in addition to improvingclassification accuracy, we demonstrate that SE also enhances the model'sgeneralize ability.",Haoqi Zheng,2023/5/22,2023/11/27

Recent studies have shown that directly applyinggeneral purpose emotion classification tools to SE corpora is not effective.Even within the SE domain, tool performance degrades significantly when trainedon one communication channel and evaluated on another (e.g, StackOverflow vs.GitHub comments). Retraining a tool with channel-specific data takessignificant effort since manually annotating large datasets of ground truthdata is expensive.  In this paper, we address this data scarcity problem by automaticallycreating new training data using a data augmentation technique. Based on ananalysis of the types of errors made by popular SE-specific emotion recognitiontools, we specifically target our data augmentation strategy in order toimprove the performance of emotion recognition.

Inthis work, we investigate strategies for domain-specialization in the contextof few-shot sentence classification with SEs. We first establish thatunsupervised Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) of a base Pre-trained LanguageModel (PLM) (i.e., not an SE) substantially improves the accuracy of few-shotsentence classification by up to 8.4 points. However, applying DAPT on SEs, onthe one hand, disrupts the effects of their (general-domain) Sentence EmbeddingPre-Training (SEPT). On the other hand, applying general-domain SEPT on top ofa domain-adapted base PLM (i.e., after DAPT) is effective but inefficient,since the computationally expensive SEPT needs to be executed on top of aDAPT-ed PLM of each domain. As a solution, we propose AdaSent, which decouplesSEPT from DAPT by training a SEPT adapter on the base PLM. The adapter can beinserted into DAPT-ed PLMs from any domain. We demonstrate AdaSent'seffectiveness in extensive experiments on 17 different few-shot sentenceclassification datasets. AdaSent matches or surpasses the performance of fullSEPT on DAPT-ed PLM, while substantially reducing the training costs. The codefor AdaSent is available.",Yongxin Huang,2023/11/1,2023/11/1
2305.06701v2,Extending Audio Masked Autoencoders Toward Audio Restoration,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06701v2,"Audio classification and restoration are among major downstream tasks inaudio signal processing. However, restoration derives less of a benefit frompretrained models compared to the overwhelming success of pretrained models inclassification tasks. Due to such unbalanced benefits, there has been risinginterest in how to improve the performance of pretrained models for restorationtasks, e.g., speech enhancement (SE). Previous works have shown that thefeatures extracted by pretrained audio encoders are effective for SE tasks, butthese speech-specialized encoder-only models usually require extra decoders tobecome compatible with SE, and involve complicated pretraining procedures orcomplex data augmentation. Therefore, in pursuit of a universal audio model,the audio masked autoencoder (MAE) whose backbone is the autoencoder of VisionTransformers (ViT-AE), is extended from audio classification to SE, arepresentative restoration task with well-established evaluation standards.ViT-AE learns to restore masked audio signal via a mel-to-mel mapping duringpretraining, which is similar to restoration tasks like SE. We proposevariations of ViT-AE for a better SE performance, where the mel-to-melvariations yield high scores in non-intrusive metrics and the STFT-orientedvariation is effective at intrusive metrics such as PESQ. Different variationscan be used in accordance with the scenarios. Comprehensive evaluations revealthat MAE pretraining is beneficial to SE tasks and help the ViT-AE to bettergeneralize to out-of-domain distortions. We further found that large-scalenoisy data of general audio sources, rather than clean speech, is sufficientlyeffective for pretraining.",Zhi Zhong,2023/5/11,2023/8/17

Determining which time scales play key roles in the SEviolation remains elusive without the measurement of $\eta$. Here we providecomprehensive simulation results of the dynamic properties involving $\eta$ and$D$ in TIP4P/2005 supercooled water. This enabled the thorough identificationof the appropriate time scales for SE relation $D\eta/T$. In particular, it isdemonstrated that the temperature dependence of various time scales associatedwith structural relaxation, hydrogen bond breakage, stress relaxation, anddynamic heterogeneities can be definitely classified into only two classes.That is, we propose the generalized SE relations that exhibit ""violation"" or""preservation"". The classification depends on the examined time scales that arecoupled or decoupled with the diffusion. On the basis of the classification, weexplain the physical origins of the violation in terms of the increase in theplateau modulus and the nonexponentiality of stress relaxation. This impliesthat the mechanism of SE violation is attributed to the attained solidity uponsupercooling, which is in accord with the growth of non-Gaussianity andspatially heterogeneous dynamics.",Takeshi Kawasaki,2017/1/21,2017/8/1

The CITISEN provides three functions: speechenhancement (SE), model adaptation (MA), and background noise conversion (BNC),allowing CITISEN to be used as a platform for utilizing and evaluating SEmodels and flexibly extend the models to address various noise environments andusers. For SE, a pretrained SE model downloaded from the cloud server is usedto effectively reduce noise components from instant or saved recordingsprovided by users. For encountering unseen noise or speaker environments, theMA function is applied to promote CITISEN. A few audio samples recording on anoisy environment are uploaded and used to adapt the pretrained SE model on theserver. Finally, for BNC, CITISEN first removes the background noises throughan SE model and then mixes the processed speech with new background noise. Thenovel BNC function can evaluate SE performance under specific conditions, coverpeople's tracks, and provide entertainment. The experimental results confirmedthe effectiveness of SE, MA, and BNC functions. Compared with the noisy speechsignals, the enhanced speech signals achieved about 6\% and 33\% ofimprovements, respectively, in terms of short-time objective intelligibility(STOI) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). With MA, the STOIand PESQ could be further improved by approximately 6\% and 11\%, respectively.Finally, the BNC experiment results indicated that the speech signals convertedfrom noisy and silent backgrounds have a close scene identification accuracyand similar embeddings in an acoustic scene classification model. Therefore,the proposed BNC can effectively convert the background noise of a speechsignal and be a data augmentation method when clean speech signals areunavailable.",Yu-Wen Chen,2020/8/21,2022/4/25

Differential invariants are equivariantoperators computed from the partial derivatives of a function.

Moreover, existing SE benchmarks mainly considersentence pairs with low lexical overlap, so it is unclear how the SEs behavewhen two sentences have high lexical overlap. We introduce a high-quality SEdiagnostic dataset, HEROS. HEROS is constructed by transforming an originalsentence into a new sentence based on certain rules to form a \textit{minimalpair}, and the minimal pair has high lexical overlaps. The rules includereplacing a word with a synonym, an antonym, a typo, a random word, andconverting the original sentence into its negation. Different rules yielddifferent subsets of HEROS. By systematically comparing the performance of over60 supervised and unsupervised SEs on HEROS, we reveal that most unsupervisedsentence encoders are insensitive to negation. We find the datasets used totrain the SE are the main determinants of what kind of sentence pairs an SEconsiders similar. We also show that even if two SEs have similar performanceon STS benchmarks, they can have very different behavior on HEROS.

Although the use of adapters has shown promising results in manyNLP-based downstream tasks, their application and exploration in SE-baseddownstream tasks are limited.  Here, we study the knowledge transfer using adapters on multiple downstreamtasks including cloze test, code clone detection, and code summarization. Theseadapters are trained on code corpora and are inserted into a PLM that ispre-trained on English corpora or code corpora. We called these PLMs as NL-PLMand C-PLM, respectively. We observed an improvement in results using NL-PLMover a PLM that does not have adapters, and this suggested that adapters cantransfer and utilize useful knowledge from NL-PLM to SE tasks. The results aresometimes on par with or exceed the results of C-PLM; while being moreefficient in terms of the number of parameters and training time.Interestingly, adapters inserted into a C-PLM generally yield better resultsthan a traditional fine-tuned C-PLM.

The group product of the special Euclideanmotion group $SE(2)$ describes how a concatenation of two roto-translationsresults in a net roto-translation. We encode this geometric structure intoconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) via $SE(2)$ group convolutional layers,which fit into the standard 2D CNN framework, and which allow to genericallydeal with rotated input samples without the need for data augmentation.  We introduce three layers: a lifting layer which lifts a 2D (vector valued)image to an $SE(2)$-image, i.e., 3D (vector valued) data whose domain is$SE(2)$; a group convolution layer from and to an $SE(2)$-image; and aprojection layer from an $SE(2)$-image to a 2D image. The lifting and groupconvolution layers are $SE(2)$ covariant (the output roto-translates with theinput). The final projection layer, a maximum intensity projection overrotations, makes the full CNN rotation invariant.  We show with three different problems in histopathology, retinal imaging, andelectron microscopy that with the proposed group CNNs, state-of-the-artperformance can be achieved, without the need for data augmentation by rotationand with increased performance compared to standard CNNs that do rely onaugmentation.",Erik J Bekkers,2018/4/10,2018/6/11

To explore the relationship between these breakdowns anddynamical heterogeneities (DH), we also calculate the SE and SED relations forsubsets of the 7% ``fastest'' and 7% ``slowest'' molecules. We find that the SEand SED relations break down in both subsets, and that the breakdowns occur onall scales of mobility. Thus these breakdowns appear to be generalizedphenomena, in contrast with the view where only the most mobile molecules arethe origin of the breakdown of the SE and SED relations, embedded in aninactive background where these relations hold. At low temperature, the SE andSED relations in both subsets of molecules are replaced with ``fractional'' SEand SED relations, $D_t\sim(\tau/T)^{-\xi_t}$ and $D_r\sim(\tau/T)^{-\xi_r}$where $\xi_t\approx0.84<1$ and $\xi_r\approx0.75<1$. We also find that there isa decoupling between rotational and translational motion, and that thisdecoupling occurs in both fastest and slowest subsets of molecules. We alsofind that when the decoupling increases, upon cooling, the probability of amolecule being classified as both translationally and rotationally fastest alsoincreases. To study the effect of time scale for SE and SED breakdown anddecoupling, we introduce a time-dependent version of the SE and SED relations,and a time-dependent function that measures the extent of decoupling. Ourresults suggest that both the decoupling and SE and SED breakdowns areoriginated at the time scale corresponding to the end of the cage regime, whendiffusion starts.

With the proposed AV2AV, two keyadvantages can be brought: 1) We can perform real-like conversations withindividuals worldwide in a virtual meeting by utilizing our own primarylanguages. In contrast to Speech-to-Speech Translation (A2A), which solelytranslates between audio modalities, the proposed AV2AV directly translatesbetween audio-visual speech. This capability enhances the dialogue experienceby presenting synchronized lip movements along with the translated speech. 2)We can improve the robustness of the spoken language translation system. Byemploying the complementary information of audio-visual speech, the system caneffectively translate spoken language even in the presence of acoustic noise,showcasing robust performance. To mitigate the problem of the absence of aparallel AV2AV translation dataset, we propose to train our spoken languagetranslation system with the audio-only dataset of A2A.

Deep learning of geometric priors from 2D images oftenrequires each image to be represented in a $2D$ canonical frame and the priorto be learned in a given or learned $3D$ canonical frame. In this paper, givenonly the relative poses of the cameras, we show how to learn priors frommultiple views equivariant to coordinate frame transformations by proposing an$SE(3)$-equivariant convolution and transformer in the space of rays in 3D.This enables the creation of a light field that remains equivariant to thechoice of coordinate frame.

We modelthe ray space, the domain of the light field, as a homogeneous space of $SE(3)$and introduce the $SE(3)$-equivariant convolution in ray space. Depending onthe output domain of the convolution, we present convolution-based$SE(3)$-equivariant maps from ray space to ray space and to $\mathbb{R}^3$. Ourmathematical framework allows us to go beyond convolution to$SE(3)$-equivariant attention in the ray space.

For this purpose, we calculated various time correlation functions,such as the mean-squared displacement, stress relaxation function, densitycorrelation function, hydrogen-bond correlation function, rotationalcorrelation function of molecular orientation, non-Gaussian parameter, andfour-point correlation function. Our study of the SE and SED relationsindicates that the transport coefficients and timescales obtained using thesetime correlation functions may be classified into two distinct classes: thosegoverned by either mobile or immobile molecules, due to dynamicalheterogeneity. In particular, we show that the stress relaxation time,hydrogen-bond lifetime, and large-angle rotational relaxation time are coupledwith translational diffusion, and are characterized by mobile molecules. Incontrast, the structural $\alpha$-relaxation time, small-angle rotationalrelaxation time, and characteristic timescales of four-point correlationfunctions are decoupled with translational diffusion, and are governed byimmobile molecules. This decoupling results in a violation of the SE relation.These results indicate that the identification of timescales that appropriatelycharacterize transport coefficients, such as translational diffusion constantand shear viscosity, provides a deep insight into the violation of the SE andSED relations in glass-forming liquids.",Takeshi Kawasaki,2019/1/10,2019/8/9

Such algorithms are usually commissioned and certified using datafrom outside the SE domain. Can we assume that such algorithms can be used''off-the-shelf'' (i.e. with no modifications)? To say that another way, arethere special features of SE problems that suggest a different and better wayto use AI tools?  To answer these questions, this paper reports experiments with TimeLIME, avariant of the LIME explanation algorithm from KDD'16. LIME can offerrecommendations on how to change static code attributes in order to reduce thenumber of defects in the next software release. That version of LIME used aninternal weighting tool to decide what attributes to include/exclude in thoserecommendations. TimeLIME improves on that weighting scheme using the followingSE knowledge: software comes in releases; an implausible change to software issomething that has never been changed in prior releases; so it is better to useplausible changes, i.e. changes with some precedent in the prior releases.

However, most existing KG embedding modelsneglect space and, therefore, do not perform well when applied to (geo)spatialdata and tasks. For those models that consider space, most of them primarilyrely on some notions of distance. These models suffer from higher computationalcomplexity during training while still losing information beyond the relativedistance between entities. In this work, we propose a location-aware KGembedding model called SE-KGE. It directly encodes spatial information such aspoint coordinates or bounding boxes of geographic entities into the KGembedding space. The resulting model is capable of handling different types ofspatial reasoning. We also construct a geographic knowledge graph as well as aset of geographic query-answer pairs called DBGeo to evaluate the performanceof SE-KGE in comparison to multiple baselines. Evaluation results show thatSE-KGE outperforms these baselines on the DBGeo dataset for geographic logicquery answering task. This demonstrates the effectiveness of ourspatially-explicit model and the importance of considering the scale ofdifferent geographic entities. Finally, we introduce a novel downstream taskcalled spatial semantic lifting which links an arbitrary location in the studyarea to entities in the KG via some relations.

Currently, it is an openquestion whether and how traditional SE approaches to self-adaptation considerproperties from CT. Answering this question is challenging given the principledifferences in representing properties in both fields. In this paper, we take afirst step to answer this question. We follow a bottom up approach where wespecify a control design (in Simulink) for a case inspired by Scuderia Ferrari(F1) and provide evidence for stability and safety. The design is thentransferred into code (in C) that is further optimized. Next, we defineproperties that enable verifying whether the control properties still hold atcode level. Then, we consolidate the solution by mapping the properties in bothworlds using specification patterns as common language and we verify thecorrectness of this mapping. The mapping offers a reusable artifact to solvesimilar problems.

The biggest challenge of text mining is high dimensional data, i.e., acorpus of documents can contain $10^4$ to $10^6$ unique words. To address thiscomplexity, some very convoluted text mining methods have been applied. Is thatcomplexity necessary? Are there simpler ways to quickly generate models thatperform as well as the more convoluted methods and also be human-readable?  To answer these questions, we explore a combination of LDA (Latent DirichletAllocation) and FFTs (Fast and Frugal Trees) to classify NASA software bugreports from six different projects. Designed using principles frompsychological science, FFTs return very small models that arehuman-comprehensible. When compared to the commonly used text mining method anda recent state-of-the-art-system (search-based SE method that automaticallytune the control parameters of LDA), these FFT models are very small (a binarytree of depth $d = 4$ that references only 4 topics) and hence easy tounderstand. They were also faster to generate and produced similar or betterseverity predictions.  Hence we can conclude that, at least for datasets explored here, convolutedtext mining models can be deprecated in favor of simpler method such asLDA+FFTs.

Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access(NOMA) has been proposed to improve the system spectral efficiency (SE) of thefifth-generation (5G) networks by allowing concurrent transmissions of multipleusers in the same spectrum. As such, NOMA has been recently considered for theuplink of WPCNs based IoT networks with a massive number of devices. However,simultaneous transmissions in NOMA may also incur more transmit energyconsumption as well as circuit energy consumption in practice which is criticalfor energy constrained IoT devices. As a result, compared to orthogonalmultiple access schemes such as time-division multiple access (TDMA), whetherthe SE can be improved and/or the total energy consumption can be reduced withNOMA in such a scenario still remains unknown. To answer this question, wefirst derive the optimal time allocations for maximizing the SE of a TDMA-basedWPCN (T-WPCN) and a NOMA-based WPCN (N-WPCN), respectively. Subsequently, weanalyze the total energy consumption as well as the maximum SE achieved bythese two networks.

Although the one-step RSB (1RSB) saddle point equationswere given for the optimal estimator, the question remains: how to achieve the1RSB prediction?

VASP has acomplexity as low as VAMP, while embracing VAMP as a special case. The SEderived for VASP can capture precisely the per-iteration behavior of thesimulated algorithm, and the SE's fixed point equations perfectly matchKabashima's 1RSB prediction, which indicates VASP can achieve the optimalperformance even in a model-mismatched setting with 1RSB.

In addition, QA models fail to generalize to other domains andadversarial test sets, while humans maintain high accuracy. Based on theseobservations, we assume that QA models do not use intended features necessaryfor human reading but rely on spurious features, causing the lack ofgeneralization ability. Therefore, we attempt to answer the question: If theoverconfident predictions of QA models for various types of perturbations arepenalized, will the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization be improved? Toprevent models from making confident predictions on perturbed inputs, we firstfollow existing studies and maximize the entropy of the output probability forperturbed inputs. However, we find that QA models trained to be sensitive to acertain perturbation type are often insensitive to unseen types ofperturbations. Thus, we simultaneously maximize the entropy for the fourperturbation types (i.e., word- and sentence-level shuffling and deletion) tofurther close the gap between models and humans. Contrary to our expectations,although models become sensitive to the four types of perturbations, we findthat the OOD generalization is not improved. Moreover, the OOD generalizationis sometimes degraded after entropy maximization. Making unconfidentpredictions on largely perturbed inputs per se may be beneficial to gaininghuman trust. However, our negative results suggest that researchers should payattention to the side effect of entropy maximization.",Kazutoshi Shinoda,2022/11/29,2022/11/29

In order to find an appropriate combination and reduce the impact ofspeech distortion caused by SE, in this paper we therefore propose a jointpre-training approach for the SE module and the self-supervised model.

Second,we propose a dual-attention fusion method to fuse the features of noisy andenhanced speeches, which can compensate the information loss caused byseparately using individual modules. Due to the flexible exploitation ofclean/noisy/enhanced branches, the proposed method turns out to be ageneralization of some existing noise-robust ASR models, e.g., enhancedwav2vec2.0.

1803.11466v1,Generating Functional Analysis of Iterative Sparse Signal Recovery Algorithms with Divergence-Free Estimators,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11466v1,"Approximate message passing (AMP) is an effective iterative sparse recoveryalgorithm for linear system models. Its performance is characterized by thestate evolution (SE) which is a simple scalar recursion. However, depending ona measurement matrix ensemble, AMP may face a convergence problem. To avoidthis problem, orthogonal AMP (OAMP), which uses de-correlation linearestimation and divergence-free non-linear estimation, was proposed by Ma andPing. They also provide the SE analysis for OAMP. In their SE analysis, thefollowing two assumptions were made: (i) The estimated vector of thede-correlation linear estimator consists of i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian entriesindependent of the vector to be estimated and (ii) the estimated vector of thedivergence-free non-linear estimator consists of i.i.d. entries independent ofthe measurement matrix and the noise vector. In this paper, we derive a simplescalar recursion to characterize iterative sparse recovery algorithms withdivergence-free estimators without such assumptions of independence of messagesby using the generating functional analysis (GFA), which allows us to study thedynamics by an exact way in the large system limit.",Kazushi Mimura,2018/3/28,2018/3/28

The performance of any IR method criticallydepends on selecting an appropriate similarity measure for the givenapplication domain. Since different SE tasks operate on different documenttypes like bug reports, software descriptions, source code, etc. that oftencontain non-standard domain-specific vocabulary, it is essential to understandwhich similarity measures work best for different SE documents.  This paper presents two case studies on the effect of different similaritymeasure on various SE documents w.r.t. two tasks: (i) project recommendation:finding similar GitHub projects and (ii) bug localization: retrieving buggysource file(s) correspond to a bug report. These tasks contain a diversecombination of textual (i.e. description, readme) and code (i.e. source code,API, import package) artifacts. We observe that the performance of IR modelsvaries when applied to different artifact types. We find that, in general, thecontext-aware models achieve better performance on textual artifacts. Incontrast, simple keyword-based bag-of-words models perform better on codeartifacts. On the other hand, the probabilistic ranking model BM25 performsbetter on a mixture of text and code artifacts.  We further investigate how such an informed choice of similarity measureimpacts the performance of SE tools. In particular, we analyze two previouslyproposed tools for project recommendation and bug localization tasks, whichleverage diverse software artifacts, and observe that an informed choice ofsimilarity measure indeed leads to improved performance of the existing SEtools.",Md Masudur Rahman,2018/8/8,2018/8/8

Unfortunately,recent work reported that current mainstream tools for sentiment analysis stillcannot provide reliable results when analyzing the sentiments in SE texts.

The use of robots for underwater operations has becomea trend. However, the underwater image acquisition has defects such as weaklight, low resolution, and many interferences, while the existing targetdetection algorithms are not effective.

This level oftransparency into LLMs' predictions would yield significant safety benefits.However, we find that CoT explanations can systematically misrepresent the truereason for a model's prediction. We demonstrate that CoT explanations can beheavily influenced by adding biasing features to model inputs--e.g., byreordering the multiple-choice options in a few-shot prompt to make the answeralways ""(A)""--which models systematically fail to mention in theirexplanations.

The magnitude and direction ofthe polarization can be changed by a previously unexplored rotation of theconstituent chains. In that case, an in-plane polarization direction may changeto out-of-plane in alpha-Se and delta-Se, flip its direction, and evendisappear in tau-Se.

Hence, inspired by how humans can learn from both positive andnegative examples, we propose contrastive chain of thought to enhance languagemodel reasoning. Compared to the conventional chain of thought, our approachprovides both valid and invalid reasoning demonstrations, to guide the model toreason step-by-step while reducing reasoning mistakes.

Microstructuralchanges directed by graphene substrate in KxSe cathode are contrasted withgraphene-free cathode. Graphene's binding affinity for long-chain polyselenides(Se-Se-Se = -2.82 eV and Se-Se = -2.646 eV) and ability to induce reactivitybetween Se and K are investigated. Furthermore, intercalation voltage forgraphene enclosed KxSe cathode reaction intermediates are calculated with K2Seas the final discharged product. Our results indicate a single-step reactionnear a voltage of 1.55 V between K and Se cathode. Our findings suggest thatoperating at higher voltages (~2V) could result in the formation of reactionintermediates where intercalation/deintercalation of K could be a challenge,and therefore cause irreversible capacity losses in the battery.

In this work, weexplore an alternative reasoning approach: instead of explicitly producing thechain of thought reasoning steps, we use the language model's internal hiddenstates to perform implicit reasoning. The implicit reasoning steps aredistilled from a teacher model trained on explicit chain-of-thought reasoning,and instead of doing reasoning ""horizontally"" by producing intermediate wordsone-by-one, we distill it such that the reasoning happens ""vertically"" amongthe hidden states in different layers.

Therefore, we propose Graph-of-Thought (GoT)reasoning, which models human thought processes not only as a chain but also asa graph. By representing thought units as nodes and connections between them asedges, our approach captures the non-sequential nature of human thinking andallows for a more realistic modeling of thought processes. Similar toMultimodal-CoT, we modeled GoT reasoning as a two-stage framework, generatingrationales first and then producing the final answer. Specifically, we employan additional graph-of-thoughts encoder for GoT representation learning andfuse the GoT representation with the original input representation through agated fusion mechanism.

However, forclose-in SEs, tidal dissipation is significant and suppresses the chaos,instead driving the spin into various steady states. We find that theattracting steady states of the SE's spin are more numerous than previouslythought, due to the discovery of a new class of ""mixed-mode"" high-obliquityequilibria. These new equilibria arise due to subharmonic responses of theparametrically-driven planetary spin, an unusual phenomenon that arises innonlinear systems.

In thisstudy, we discuss both experimentally and theoretically the relationshipbetween the trimer structure that appears in the layered LiV$X_2$ ($X$ = O, S,Se) system with a two-dimensional triangular lattice of vanadium and the zigzagchain-like local structure that appears near the phase transition boundarywhere molecular formation occurs. The vanadium trimerization that persistentlyappears in both low-temperature phases of LiVO$_2$ and LiVS$_2$ disappears inLiVSe$_2$, and a regular triangular lattice is thought to be realized inLiVSe$_2$, but this study reveals that the zigzag chain local distortionappears with a finite correlation length. This zigzag chain state localdistortions are similar to the motif of local distortions in thehigh-temperature phase of LiVS$_2$, indicating that the local distortions arepersistent away from the trimer phase transition boundary. On the other hand,it is concluded that the zigzag chain order appearing in LiVSe$_2$ is morestable than that in LiVS$_2$ in terms of the temperature variation of atomicdisplacement and correlation length. The zigzag chain order is considered to becompetitive with the trimer order appearing in the LiV$X_2$ system.

In thispaper, we analyze the impact of PA on the SE-EE tradeoff of orthogonalfrequency division multiplex (OFDM) systems. An ideal PA that is always linearand incurs no additional power consumption can be shown to yield a decreasingconvex function in the SE-EE tradeoff. In contrast, we show that a practical PAhas an SE-EE tradeoff that has a turning point and decreases sharply after itsmaximum EE point. In other words, the Pareto-optimal tradeoff boundary of theSE-EE curve is very narrow. A wide range of SE-EE tradeoff, however, is desiredfor future wireless communications that have dynamic demand depending on thetraffic loads, channel conditions, and system applications, e.g.,high-SE-with-low-EE for rate-limited systems and high-EE-with-low-SE forenergy-limited systems. For the SE-EE tradeoff improvement, we propose a PAswitching (PAS) technique. In a PAS transmitter, one or more PAs are switchedon intermittently to maximize the EE and deliver an overall required SE. As aconsequence, a high EE over a wide range SE can be achieved, which is verifiedby numerical evaluations: with 15% SE reduction for low SE demand, the PASbetween a low power PA and a high power PA can improve EE by 323%, while asingle high power PA transmitter improves EE by only 68%.",Jingon Joung,2013/5/17,2013/5/17

We developed an automated method, GALtoICL,based on the software GALAPAGOS to obtain a refined version of typical BCG+ICLmaps. We applied this method to our test case MACS J1206.2-0847, a massivecluster located at z=0.44, that is part of the CLASH sample. Using deepmulti-band SUBARU images, we extracted the surface brightness (SB) profile ofthe BCG+ICL and we studied the ICL morphology, color, and contribution to f*out to R500. We repeated the same analysis using a different definition of theICL, SBlimit method, i.e. a SB cut-off level, to compare the results. The mostpeculiar feature of the ICL in MACS1206 is its asymmetric radial distribution,with an excess in the SE direction and extending towards the 2nd brightestcluster galaxy which is a Post Starburst galaxy. This suggests an interactionbetween the BCG and this galaxy that dates back to t <= 1.5 Gyr. The BCG+ICLstellar content is 8% of M_(*,500) and the (de-) projected baryon fraction instars is f*=0.0177 (0.0116), in excellent agreement with recent results. TheSBlimit method provides systematically higher ICL fractions and this effect islarger at lower SB limits. This is due to the light from the outer envelopes ofmember galaxies that contaminate the ICL. Though more time consuming, theGALtoICL method provides safer ICL detections that are almost free of thiscontamination. This is one of the few ICL study at redshift z > 0.3. Atcompletion, the CLASH/VLT program will allow us to extend this analysis to astatistically significant cluster sample spanning a wide redshift range:0.2<z<0.6.",V. Presotto,2014/3/19,2014/3/19

We characterizeseveral Out-of-Distribution (OOD) cases for ICL inspired by realistic LLM ICLfailures and compare transformers with DeepSet, a simple yet powerfularchitecture for ICL. Surprisingly, DeepSet outperforms transformers across avariety of distribution shifts, implying that preserving permutation invariancesymmetry to input demonstrations is crucial for OOD ICL. The phenomenonspecifies a fundamental requirement by ICL, which we termed as ICL invariance.Nevertheless, the positional encodings in LLMs will break ICL invariance.

Inthis paper, we provide novel insights into how ICL leverages label information,revealing both capabilities and limitations. To ensure we obtain acomprehensive picture of ICL behavior, we study probabilistic aspects of ICLpredictions and thoroughly examine the dynamics of ICL as more examples areprovided. Our experiments show that ICL predictions almost always depend onin-context labels, and that ICL can learn truly novel tasks in-context.However, we also find that ICL struggles to fully overcome predictionpreferences acquired from pre-training data, and, further, that ICL does notconsider all in-context information equally.",Jannik Kossen,2023/7/23,2023/10/3

Differing from thestandard N-shot learning approach, Batch-ICL employs $N$ separate 1-shotforward computations and aggregates the resulting meta-gradients. Theseaggregated meta-gradients are then applied to a zero-shot learning to generatethe final prediction. This batch processing approach renders the LLM agnosticto the order of ICL examples.

By measuring the ICL of theclusters using multiple techniques, we identify systematic differences in howeach detection method identifies the ICL. We find that techniques which definethe ICL solely based on the current position of the cluster luminosity, such asa surface brightness or local density threshold, tend to find less ICL thanmethods utilizing time or velocity information, including stellar particles'density history or binding energy. The range of ICL fractions (the fraction ofthe clusters' total luminosity found in the ICL component) we measure at z=0across all our clusters using any definition span the range from 9-36%, andeven within a single cluster different methods can change the measured ICLfraction by up to a factor of two. Separating the cluster's central galaxy fromthe surrounding ICL component is a challenge for all ICL techniques, andbecause the ICL is centrally concentrated within the cluster, the differencesin the measured ICL quantity between techniques are largely a consequence ofthis central galaxy/ICL separation. We thoroughly explore the free parametersinvolved with each measurement method, and find that adjusting these parameterscan change the measured ICL fraction by up to a factor of two. While for alldefinitions the quantity of ICL tends to increase with time, the ICL fractiondoes not grow at a uniform rate, nor even monotonically under some definitions.Thus, the ICL can be used as a rough indicator of dynamical age, where moredynamically advanced clusters will on average have higher ICL fractions.",Craig S.

Prior work hasprovided a deeper understanding of how ICL emerges in transformers, e.g.through the lens of mechanistic interpretability, Bayesian inference, or byexamining the distributional properties of training data. However, in each ofthese cases, ICL is treated largely as a persistent phenomenon; namely, onceICL emerges, it is assumed to persist asymptotically. Here, we show that theemergence of ICL during transformer training is, in fact, often transient. Wetrain transformers on synthetic data designed so that both ICL and in-weightslearning (IWL) strategies can lead to correct predictions. We find that ICLfirst emerges, then disappears and gives way to IWL, all while the trainingloss decreases, indicating an asymptotic preference for IWL. The transientnature of ICL is observed in transformers across a range of model sizes anddatasets, raising the question of how much to ""overtrain"" transformers whenseeking compact, cheaper-to-run models. We find that L2 regularization mayoffer a path to more persistent ICL that removes the need for early stoppingbased on ICL-style validation tasks. Finally, we present initial evidence thatICL transience may be caused by competition between ICL and IWL circuits.",Aaditya K. Singh,2023/11/14,2023/12/11

In this work, we revisit the comparison between ICLand GD-based finetuning and study what properties of ICL an equivalent processmust follow. We highlight a major difference in the flow of information betweenICL and standard finetuning.

Detailed analyses suggest that the width of point spreadfunction has a significant effect on the measured ICL fraction, while therelatively small pixel size shows almost no influence. It is found that themeasured ICL fraction depends strongly on the SBL. At a fixed SBL and redshift,the measured ICL fraction decreases with increasing halo mass, while with amuch faint SBL, it does not depend on halo mass at low redshifts. In our work,the measured ICL fraction shows clear dependence on the cosmological redshiftdimming effect.

The observed scatter is physical, which weassociate with differences in ICL assembly process, formation epoch, and/or ICLcontent. Using stellar population synthesis models we transform the observedcolors to metallicity.

Such negative color/metallicity gradients canarise from tidal stripping of L* galaxies and/or the disruption of dwarfgalaxies, but not major mergers with the BCG. We also find that the ICL at 110kpc has a color comparable to m*+2 red sequence galaxies and a total luminositybetween 10<r<110 kpc of 4-8 L*.

Here, we empirically analyze the amount ofspatial context needed for effective channel attention and find that limitedlocalcontext on the order of seven rows or columns of the original image issufficient to match the performance of global context. We propose tiledsqueeze-and-excite (TSE), which is a framework for building SE-like blocks thatemploy several descriptors per channel, with each descriptor based on localcontext only. We further show that TSE is a drop-in replacement for the SEblock and can be used in existing SE networks without re-training. This impliesthat local context descriptors are similar both to each other and to the globalcontext descriptor. Finally, we show that TSE has important practicalimplications for deployment of SE-networks to dataflow AI accelerators due totheir reduced pipeline buffering requirements. For example, using TSE reducesthe amount of activation pipeline buffering in EfficientDetD2 by 90% comparedto SE (from 50M to 4.77M) without loss of accuracy.

2009.05926v1,On the Use of Grey Literature: A Survey with the Brazilian Software Engineering Research Community,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05926v1,"Background: The use of Grey Literature (GL) has been investigate in diverseresearch areas. In Software Engineering (SE), this topic has an increasinginterest over the last years. Problem: Even with the increase of GL publishedin diverse sources, the understanding of their use on the SE research communityis still controversial. Objective: To understand how Brazilian SE researchersuse GL, we aimed to become aware of the criteria to assess the credibility oftheir use, as well as the benefits and challenges. Method: We surveyed 76active SE researchers participants of a flagship SE conference in Brazil, usinga questionnaire with 11 questions to share their views on the use of GL in thecontext of SE research. We followed a qualitative approach to analyze openquestions. Results: We found that most surveyed researchers use GL mainly tounderstand new topics. Our work identified new findings, including: 1) GLsources used by SE researchers (e.g., blogs, community website); 2) motivationsto use (e.g., to understand problems and to complement research findings) orreasons to avoid GL (e.g., lack of reliability, lack of scientific value); 3)the benefit that is easy to access and read GL and the challenge of GL to haveits scientific value recognized; and 4) criteria to assess GL credibility,showing the importance of the content owner to be renowned (e.g., renownedauthor and institutions). Conclusions: Our findings contribute to form a bodyof knowledge on the use of GL by SE researchers, by discussing novel (somecontradictory) results and providing a set of lessons learned to both SEresearchers and practitioners.",Fernando Kamei,2020/9/13,2020/9/13

Directly applying existing in-context models from otherareas onto skeleton sequences fails due to the inter-frame and cross-task posesimilarity that makes it outstandingly hard to perceive the task correctly froma subtle context.

Nonetheless, onlya special class of observable susceptibilities obey Kramers-Kronig relations.Specific results are provided for arbitrary order harmonic response, whichallows for a very comprehensive Kramers-Kronig analysis and the establishmentof sum rules connecting the asymptotic behavior of the susceptibility to theshort-time response of the system. These results generalize previous findingson optical Hamiltonian systems and simple mechanical models, and shed light onthe general impact of considering the principle of causality for testingself-consistency: the described dispersion relations constitute unavoidablebenchmarks for any experimental and model generated dataset. In order toconnect the response theory for equilibrium and non equilibrium systems, werewrite the classical results by Kubo so that response functions formallyidentical to those proposed by Ruelle, apart from the measure involved in thephase space integration, are obtained.

To effectively depict theknowledge of past classes, class prompt leverages Bayesian DistributionAlignment to model the distribution of classes in each task. To reduce theforgetting of past task knowledge, task prompt employs Cross-task KnowledgeExcavation to amalgamate the knowledge encapsulated in the learned classprompts of past tasks and current task knowledge.

To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel Knowledge-guided ContextOptimization (KgCoOp) to enhance the generalization ability of the learnableprompt for unseen classes. The key insight of KgCoOp is that forgetting aboutessential knowledge can be alleviated by reducing the discrepancy between thelearnable prompt and the hand-crafted prompt. Especially, KgCoOp minimizes thediscrepancy between the textual embeddings generated by learned prompts and thehand-crafted prompts. Finally, adding the KgCoOp upon the contrastive loss canmake a discriminative prompt for both seen and unseen tasks.

Se vacancy in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ is a doubledonor, and Bi vacancy is a triple acceptor. Se antisite (Se$_{Bi}$) is alwaysan active donor in the system because its donor level ($\varepsilon$(+1/0))enters into the conduction band. Interestingly, Bi antisite(Bi$_{Se1}$) inBi$_2$Se$_3$ is an amphoteric dopant, acting as a donor when$\mu$$_e$$<$0.119eV (the material is typical p-type) and as an acceptor when$\mu$$_e$$>$0.251eV (the material is typical n-type). The formation energiesunder different growth environments (such as Bi-rich or Se-rich) indicate thatunder Se-rich condition, Se$_{Bi}$ is the most stable native defect independentof electron chemical potential $\mu$$_e$. Under Bi-rich condition, Se vacancyis the most stable native defect except for under the growth window as$\mu$$_e$$>$0.262eV (the material is typical n-type) and$\Delta$$\mu$$_{Se}$$<$-0.459eV(Bi-rich), under such growth windows onenegative charged Bi$_{Se1}$ is the most stable one.",L.

To ascertain the existence of power-law distributions ofinter-spike intervals (ISI) occurring during the progression of statusepilepticus (SE), so that the emergence of critical states could be reasonablyhypothesized as being part of the intrinsic nature of the SE. Methods. Statusepilepticus was induced by pilocarpine administration in post-natal 21-day rats(n=8). For each animal, 24 hours of EEG from the onset of the SE were analyzedaccording to the analytical procedure suggested by Clauset et al. (2009) whichcombines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based onthe Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics and likelihood ratios. The analyticalprocedure was implemented by the freely available R software package""poweRlaw"". Time of calculations was considerably shorten by the exploitationof High-Throughput Computing technology, a.k.a. Grid Computing technology.Results. The progression of the SE is characterized by the emergence ofpower-law correlations of ISI whose likelihood of occurrence increases the morethe time from the onset of the SE elapses. Log-normal distribution of ISI ishowever widely represented. Additionally, undetermined distributions of ISI arerepresented as well, although confined within a restricted temporal window. Thefinal stage of SE appears dominated only by power-law and log-normaldistributions of ISI. Significance. The emergence of power-law correlations ofISI concretely supports the concept of the occurrence of critical states duringthe progression of SE.

1510.01588v2,Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computation with a complete graph of superconducting qubits: Beyond the single-excitation subspace,http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01588v2,"There is currently a tremendous interest in developing practical applicationsof NISQ processors without the overhead required by full error correction.Quantum information processing is especially challenging within the gate model,as algorithms quickly lose fidelity as the problem size and circuit depth grow.This has lead to a number of non-gate-model approaches such as analog quantumsimulation and quantum annealing. These approaches come with specific hardwarerequirements that are typically different than that of a universal gate-basedquantum computer. We have previously proposed a non-gate-model approach calledthe single-excitation subspace (SES) method, which requires a complete graph ofsuperconducting qubits. Like any approach lacking error correction, the SESmethod is not scalable, but it often leads to algorithms with constant depth,allowing it to outperform the gate model in a wide variety of applications. Achallenge of the SES method is that it requires a physical qubit for everybasis state in the computer's Hilbert space. This imposes large resource costsfor algorithms using registers of ancillary qubits, as each ancilla woulddouble the required graph size. Here we show how to circumvent this doubling byleaving the SES and reintroducing a tensor product structure in thecomputational subspace. Specifically, we implement the tensor product of an SESregister holding ``data"" with one or more ancilla qubits. This enables a hybridform of quantum computation where fast SES operations are performed on thedata, traditional logic gates and measurements are performed on the ancillas,and controlled-unitaries act between.

Since large size single crystal of Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$can be easily grown, many researches have been performed. However, a large partof the reported results are under controversy, including the resistivity,susceptibility, Hall effect, gap structure, phase diagram, etc. Thesecontroversies are believed to come from the sample-dependent Fenonstoichiometries, which originate from the partial occupation of the secondFe site (excess Fe) in the Te/Se layer. The excess Fe with valence near Fe$^+$will provide electron doping into the system. Meanwhile, the excess Fe is alsostrongly magnetic, which will act as a paring breaker and also localize thecharge carriers.

The adversarialprompts, crafted to mimic plausible user errors like typos or synonyms, aim toevaluate how slight deviations can affect LLM outcomes while maintainingsemantic integrity. These prompts are then employed in diverse tasks, such assentiment analysis, natural language inference, reading comprehension, machinetranslation, and math problem-solving. Our study generates 4788 adversarialprompts, meticulously evaluated over 8 tasks and 13 datasets. Our findingsdemonstrate that contemporary LLMs are not robust to adversarial prompts.Furthermore, we present comprehensive analysis to understand the mystery behindprompt robustness and its transferability. We then offer insightful robustnessanalysis and pragmatic recommendations for prompt composition, beneficial toboth researchers and everyday users.

However, such safety measures are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,which add maliciously designed token sequences to a harmful prompt to bypassthe model's safety guards. In this work, we introduce erase-and-check, thefirst framework to defend against adversarial prompts with verifiable safetyguarantees. We defend against three attack modes: i) adversarial suffix, whichappends an adversarial sequence at the end of the prompt; ii) adversarialinsertion, where the adversarial sequence is inserted anywhere in the middle ofthe prompt; and iii) adversarial infusion, where adversarial tokens areinserted at arbitrary positions in the prompt, not necessarily as a contiguousblock. Our experimental results demonstrate that this procedure can obtainstrong certified safety guarantees on harmful prompts while maintaining goodempirical performance on safe prompts. For example, against adversarialsuffixes of length 20, it certifiably detects 92% of harmful prompts and labels94% of safe prompts correctly using the open-source language model Llama 2 asthe safety filter. We further improve the filter's performance, in terms ofaccuracy and speed, by replacing Llama 2 with a DistilBERT safety classifierfine-tuned on safe and harmful prompts.

Weevaluated the transfer learning ability of the prompt-based learning algorithmsin a cross-institution setting. We also assessed the few-shot learning ability.Results and Conclusion When LLMs are unfrozen, GatorTron-3.9B with softprompting achieves the best strict F1-scores of 0.9118 and 0.8604 for conceptextraction, outperforming the traditional fine-tuning and hard prompt-basedmodels by 0.6~3.1% and 1.2~2.9%, respectively; GatorTron-345M with softprompting achieves the best F1-scores of 0.8332 and 0.7488 for end-to-endrelation extraction, outperforming the other two models by 0.2~2% and0.6~11.7%, respectively. When LLMs are frozen, small (i.e., 345 millionparameters) LLMs have a big gap to be competitive with unfrozen models; scalingLLMs up to billions of parameters makes frozen LLMs competitive with unfrozenLLMs. For cross-institute evaluation, soft prompting with a frozenGatorTron-8.9B model achieved the best performance. This study demonstratesthat (1) machines can learn soft prompts better than humans, (2) frozen LLMshave better few-shot learning ability and transfer learning ability tofacilitate muti-institution applications, and (3) frozen LLMs require largemodels.",Cheng Peng,2023/10/10,2023/10/10

In this work, wepresent Prompt Learning with Reparameterization Encoder (PRE) - a simple andefficient method that enhances the generalization ability of the learnableprompt to unseen classes while maintaining the capacity to learn Base classes.Instead of directly optimizing the prompts, PRE employs a prompt encoder toreparameterize the input prompt embeddings, enhancing the exploration oftask-specific knowledge from few-shot samples. Experiments and extensiveablation studies on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that our approach is an efficientmethod for prompt learning.

Prompt selection is the process ofidentifying the most appropriate prompt or example to help the model understandnew tasks. This is important because providing the model with relevant promptscan help it learn more effectively and efficiently. Prompt fusion involvescombining knowledge from different positions within the large-scale visualmodel. By doing this, the model can leverage the diverse knowledge stored indifferent parts of the model to improve its performance on new tasks. Basedthese findings, we propose a simple framework prompt-SelF for visual in-contextlearning. Specifically, we first use the pixel-level retrieval method to selecta suitable prompt, and then use different prompt fusion methods to activate allthe knowledge stored in the large-scale model, and finally ensemble theprediction results obtained from different prompt fusion methods to obtain thefinal prediction results. And we conduct extensive experiments on single-objectsegmentation and detection tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness ofprompt-SelF.

They havecreated an urgent need for educators to rethink pedagogical approaches andteaching strategies for newly emerging skill sets. Traditional approaches tolearning programming have focused on frequent and repeated practice at writingcode. The ease with which code can now be generated has resulted in a shift infocus towards reading, understanding and evaluating LLM-generated code. Inparallel with this shift, a new essential skill is emerging -- the ability toconstruct good prompts for code-generating models. This paper introduces anovel pedagogical concept known as a `Prompt Problem', designed to helpstudents learn how to craft effective prompts for LLMs. A Prompt Problemchallenges a student to create a natural language prompt that leads an LLM toproduce the correct code for a specific problem. To support the delivery ofPrompt Problems at scale, in this paper we also present a novel tool calledPromptly which hosts a repository of Prompt Problems and automates theevaluation of prompt-generated code. We report empirical findings from a fieldstudy in which Promptly was deployed in a first-year Python programming course(n=54). We explore student interactions with the tool and their perceptions ofthe Prompt Problem concept. We found that Promptly was largely well-received bystudents for its ability to engage their computational thinking skills andexpose them to new programming constructs.

With the development ofLarge Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in exploring thepotential of LLMs for sequential recommendation by framing it as a languagemodeling task. Prior works represent items in the textual prompts using eitherID indexing or text indexing and feed the prompts into LLMs, but falling shortof either encapsulating comprehensive world knowledge or exhibiting sufficientsequential understanding. To harness the complementary strengths of traditionalrecommenders (which encode user behavioral knowledge) and LLMs (which possessworld knowledge about items), we propose LLaRA -- a Large Language andRecommendation Assistant framework. Specifically, LLaRA represents items inLLM's input prompts using a novel hybrid approach that integrates ID-based itemembeddings from traditional recommenders with textual item features. Viewingthe ``sequential behavior of the user'' as a new modality in recommendation, weemploy an adapter to bridge the modality gap between ID embeddings of thetraditional recommenders and the input space of LLMs. Furthermore, instead ofdirectly exposing the hybrid prompt to LLMs, we apply a curriculum learningapproach to gradually ramp up training complexity. We first warm up the LLMwith text-only prompting, which aligns more naturally with the LLM's languagemodeling capabilities. Thereafter, we progressively transition to hybridprompting, training the adapter to incorporate behavioral knowledge from thetraditional sequential recommender into the LLM. Extensive experimentsdemonstrate the efficacy of LLaRA framework. Our code and data are available athttps://github.com/ljy0ustc/LLaRA .",Jiayi Liao,2023/12/5,2023/12/31

In this work, we analyse a prototypical neural network model of curriculumlearning in the high-dimensional limit, employing statistical physics methods.Curricula could in principle change both the learning speed and asymptoticperformance of a model. To study the former, we provide an exact description ofthe online learning setting, confirming the long-standing experimentalobservation that curricula can modestly speed up learning. To study the latter,we derive performance in a batch learning setting, in which a network trains toconvergence in successive phases of learning on dataset slices of varyingdifficulty. With standard training losses, curriculum does not providegeneralisation benefit, in line with empirical observations. However, we showthat by connecting different learning phases through simple Gaussian priors,curriculum can yield a large improvement in test performance.

The ToT technique is inspired by the human mind'sapproach for solving complex reasoning tasks through trial and error. In thisprocess, the human mind explores the solution space through a tree-like thoughtprocess, allowing for backtracking when necessary. To implement ToT as asoftware system, we augment an LLM with additional modules including a prompteragent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller. In order tosolve a given problem, these modules engage in a multi-round conversation withthe LLM. The memory module records the conversation and state history of theproblem solving process, which allows the system to backtrack to the previoussteps of the thought-process and explore other directions from there. To verifythe effectiveness of the proposed technique, we implemented a ToT-based solverfor the Sudoku Puzzle.

With the upgrading ofphysical goal and the developing of electronics, modern time measurement systemmeets the requirement of excellent resolution specification as well as highintegrity. Due to Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), FPGA time-to-digitalconverter (TDC) becomes one of mature and prominent time measurement methods inrecent years. For correcting time-walk effect caused by leading timing,time-over-threshold (TOT) measurement should be added in the FPGA TDC. TOT canbe obtained by measuring the interval time of signal leading and trailing edge.Unfortunately, a traditional TDC can recognize only one kind of signal edge,the leading or the trailing. Generally, to measure the interval, two TDCchannels can be used at the same time, one for leading, the other for trailing.However, this method will increase the amount of used FPGA resource and reducethe TDC's integrity unavoidably. This paper presents one method of TOTmeasurement implemented in a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA. In this method, TOT measurecan be achieved in only one TDC input channel. The consumed resources and timeresolution can both be guaranteed. Test shows that this TDC can achieveresolution better than 15 ps for leading edge measurement and 37 ps for TOTmeasurement. Furthermore, the TDC measuring dead time is about 2 clock cycles,which makes it be good for applications of higher physical event rate",Huanhuan Fan,2015/1/26,2015/1/26

Specifically, we investigate the task-dependent scaling of frontal BOLDresponses with ToT during hierarchical cognitive control. We observe aparadoxical relationship, whereby rostral regions show greater scaling with ToTon a first-order task, despite showing greater recruitment on a second-ordertask; caudal regions show the converse relationships. Together, these resultsdemonstrate that ToT does not reflect a single dimension of difficulty thatuniformly drives lateral frontal activity.

2106.14704v1,"Chat Room Using HTML, PHP, CSS, JS, AJAX",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14704v1,Earlier there was no mode of online communication between users. In big orsmall organizations communication between users posed a challenge. There was arequirement to record these communications and store the data for furtherevaluation. The idea is to automate the existing Simple Chat Room system andmake the users utilize the software so that their valuable information isstored digitally and can be retrieved for further management purposes. Therewas no online method of communicating with different users. There were manydifferent interfaces available in the market but this method of using windowssockets to communicate between nodes would be fast and reliable. The mainobjective of our Simple Chat Room project is to create a chat application thathelps different users to communicate with each other through a serverconnected. This is a simple chat program with a server and can have manyclients. The server needs to be started first and clients can be connectedlater. Simple Chat Room provides bidirectional communication between client andserver. It enables users to seamlessly communicate with each other. The usercan chat using this chat application. If the user at the other end is activethen they can start a chat session. The chat is recorded in this application.,Amey Thakur,2021/6/28,2021/6/28

There existrule-based approaches for automatically repairing Python type errors. Theapproaches can generate accurate patches but they require domain experts todesign patch synthesis rules and suffer from low template coverage ofreal-world type errors. Learning-based approaches alleviate the manual effortsin designing patch synthesis rules. Among the learning-based approaches, theprompt-based approach which leverages the knowledge base of code pre-trainedmodels via pre-defined prompts, obtains state-of-the-art performance in generalprogram repair tasks. However, such prompts are manually defined and do notinvolve any specific clues for repairing Python type errors, resulting inlimited effectiveness. How to automatically improve prompts with the domainknowledge for type error repair is challenging yet under-explored. In thispaper, we present TypeFix, a novel prompt-based approach with fix templatesincorporated for repairing Python type errors. TypeFix first mines generalizedfix templates via a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm. The identified fixtemplates indicate the common edit patterns and contexts of existing type errorfixes. TypeFix then generates code prompts for code pre-trained models byemploying the generalized fix templates as domain knowledge, in which the masksare adaptively located for each type error instead of being pre-determined.Experiments on two benchmarks, including BugsInPy and TypeBugs, show thatTypeFix successfully repairs 26 and 55 type errors, outperforming the bestbaseline approach by 9 and 14, respectively.

Such summaries play a key role inhelping developers understand and maintain source code. Recently, with thesuccessful application of large language models (LLMs) in numerous fields,software engineering researchers have also attempted to adapt LLMs to solvecode summarization tasks. The main adaptation schemes include instructionprompting and task-oriented fine-tuning. However, instruction promptinginvolves designing crafted prompts for zero-shot learning or selectingappropriate samples for few-shot learning and requires users to haveprofessional domain knowledge, while task-oriented fine-tuning requires hightraining costs. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt learning framework forcode summarization called PromptCS. PromptCS trains a prompt agent that cangenerate continuous prompts to unleash the potential for LLMs in codesummarization. Compared to the human-written discrete prompt, the continuousprompts are produced under the guidance of LLMs and are therefore easier tounderstand by LLMs. PromptCS freezes the parameters of LLMs when training theprompt agent, which can greatly reduce the requirements for training resources.We evaluate PromptCS on the CodeSearchNet dataset involving multipleprogramming languages. The results show that PromptCS significantly outperformsinstruction prompting schemes on all four widely used metrics. In some baseLLMs, e.g., CodeGen-Multi-2B and StarCoderBase-1B and -3B, PromptCS evenoutperforms the task-oriented fine-tuning scheme. More importantly, thetraining efficiency of PromptCS is faster than the task-oriented fine-tuningscheme, with a more pronounced advantage on larger LLMs. The results of thehuman evaluation demonstrate that PromptCS can generate more good summariescompared to baselines.",Weisong Sun,2023/12/26,2023/12/26

Our conclusion is that DevBots can collaborate with human APIdesigners, but the two approaches have advantages and disadvantages.",Vinicius Soares Silva Marques,2023/12/10,2023/12/10
2206.12839v3,Repository-Level Prompt Generation for Large Language Models of Code,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12839v3,"With the success of large language models (LLMs) of code and their use ascode assistants (e.g. Codex used in GitHub Copilot), techniques for introducingdomain-specific knowledge in the prompt design process become important. Inthis work, we propose a framework called Repo-Level Prompt Generator thatlearns to generate example-specific prompts using prompt proposals. The promptproposals take context from the entire repository, thereby incorporating boththe structure of the repository and the context from other relevant files (e.g.imports, parent class files). Our technique doesn't require any access to theweights of the LLM, making it applicable in cases where we only have black-boxaccess to the LLM. We conduct experiments on the task of single-linecode-autocompletion using code repositories taken from Google Code archives. Wedemonstrate that an oracle constructed from our prompt proposals gives aremarkably high relative improvement of 36% over Codex, showing the quality ofthese proposals. Further, we show that when we train a model to predict aprompt proposal, we can achieve significant performance gains over Codex andother baselines.

This paper discusses how that might be done.This is an important topic since machine learning software is increasinglybeing used to make decisions that affect people's lives. Potentially, theapplication of that software will result in fairer decisions because (unlikehumans) machine learning software is not biased. However, recent results showthat the software within many data mining packages exhibits ""groupdiscrimination""; i.e. their decisions are inappropriately affected by""protected attributes""(e.g., race, gender, age, etc.).  There has been much prior work on validating the fairness of machine-learningmodels (by recognizing when such software discrimination exists). But afterdetection, comes mitigation. What steps can ethical software engineers take toreduce discrimination in the software they produce?  This paper shows that making \textit{fairness} as a goal duringhyperparameter optimization can (a) preserve the predictive power of a modellearned from a data miner while also (b) generates fairer results.

Recently, newautomated approaches are becoming more useful. These approaches have been foundto be effective in some cases. The main weaknesses of these approaches are thatthey never exploit code dependencies and summarize either the software classesor methods but not both. This paper proposes a source code summarizationapproach (Suncode) that produces a short description for each class and methodin the software system. To validate the approach, it has been applied toseveral case studies. Moreover, the generated summaries are compared tosummaries that written by human experts and to summaries that written by astate-of-the-art solution. Results of this paper found that Suncode summariesprovide better information about code dependencies comparing with otherstudies. In addition, Suncode summaries can improve and support the currentsoftware documentation.

However, the development process of such toolsfrequently differs from conventional software development; partly because ofthe nature of research, where the problems being addressed are not always fullyunderstood; partly because the majority of the development is often carried outby scientists with limited experience and exposure to best practices ofsoftware engineering. Often the software development suffers from the pressureto publish scientific results and that credit for software development islimited in comparison. Fundamental components of software engineering likemodular and reusable design, validation, documentation, and softwareintegration as well as effective maintenance and user support tend to bedisregarded due to lack of resources and qualified specialists. Thus innovativedevelopments are often hindered by steep learning curves required to masterdevelopment for legacy software packages full of ad hoc solutions.

In recent years, researchers have begun to exploreautomatic program translation using supervised deep learning techniques bylearning from large-scale parallel code corpus. However, parallel resources arescarce in the programming language domain, and it is costly to collectbilingual data manually. To address this issue, several unsupervisedprogramming translation systems are proposed. However, these systems still relyon huge monolingual source code to train, which is very expensive. Besides,these models cannot perform well for translating the languages that are notseen during the pre-training procedure. In this paper, we propose SDA-Trans, asyntax and domain-aware model for program translation, which leverages thesyntax structure and domain knowledge to enhance the cross-lingual transferability.

Machine translation systems can return inferiorresults that lead to misunderstanding, medical misdiagnoses, threats topersonal safety, or political conflicts. Despite its apparent importance,validating the robustness of machine translation systems is very difficult andhas, therefore, been much under-explored.  To tackle this challenge, we introduce structure-invariant testing (SIT), anovel metamorphic testing approach for validating machine translation software.Our key insight is that the translation results of ""similar"" source sentencesshould typically exhibit similar sentence structures. Specifically, SIT (1)generates similar source sentences by substituting one word in a given sentencewith semantically similar, syntactically equivalent words; (2) representssentence structure by syntax parse trees (obtained via constituency ordependency parsing); (3) reports sentence pairs whose structures differquantitatively by more than some threshold.

In this work, we examine a common exampleof this phenomenon: the conceit that ""software patching is like languagetranslation"". We demonstrate empirically that there are subtle, but criticaldistinctions between sequence-to-sequence models and translation model: whileprogram repair benefits greatly from the former, general modeling architecture,it actually suffers from design decisions built into the latter, both in termsof translation accuracy and diversity. Given these findings, we demonstrate howa more principled approach to model design, based on our empirical findings andgeneral knowledge of software development, can lead to better solutions. Ourfindings also lend strong support to the recent trend towards synthesizingedits of code conditional on the buggy context, to repair bugs. We implementsuch models ourselves as ""proof-of-concept"" tools and empirically confirm thatthey behave in a fundamentally different, more effective way than the studiedtranslation-based architectures.

We examine the performance of those methods to detect differentfaults during flight in a closed-loop setup. All selected methods showacceptable detection performance. However, it is not possible to repeat thetest for every possible conditions, inputs and fault scenarios. In this paper,we translate fault detection properties and mathematical proofs into a formallanguage, previously used in software validation and verification. We includethe translated properties in software in the form of non-executable annotationsthat can be read by machine. Consequently, some high level functionalproperties of the code can be verified by automatic software verificationtools.

Unfortunately, erroneous translationsmay result in severe consequences, such as financial losses. This requires toimprove the accuracy and the reliability of machine translation systems.However, it is challenging to test machine translation systems because of thecomplexity and intractability of the underlying neural models. To tackle thesechallenges, we propose a novel metamorphic testing approach by syntactic treepruning (STP) to validate machine translation systems. Our key insight is thata pruned sentence should have similar crucial semantics compared with theoriginal sentence. Specifically, STP (1) proposes a core semantics-preservingpruning strategy by basic sentence structure and dependency relations on thelevel of syntactic tree representation; (2) generates source sentence pairsbased on the metamorphic relation; (3) reports suspicious issues whosetranslations break the consistency property by a bag-of-words model. We furtherevaluate STP on two state-of-the-art machine translation systems (i.e., GoogleTranslate and Bing Microsoft Translator) with 1,200 source sentences as inputs.The results show that STP can accurately find 5,073 unique erroneoustranslations in Google Translate and 5,100 unique erroneous translations inBing Microsoft Translator (400% more than state-of-the-art techniques), with64.5% and 65.4% precision, respectively. The reported erroneous translationsvary in types and more than 90% of them cannot be found by state-of-the-arttechniques. There are 9,393 erroneous translations unique to STP, which is711.9% more than state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, STP is quite effectiveto detect translation errors for the original sentences with a recall reaching74.0%, improving state-of-the-art techniques by 55.1% on average.",Quanjun Zhang,2024/1/1,2024/1/1

Acomprehensive empirical analysis is conducted on six software text datasets toidentify conflicts and duplicates among sentence pairs. The results demonstratethat data augmentation techniques have a significant impact on the performanceof all software pair text datasets. On the other hand, in cases where thedatasets are relatively balanced, the use of augmentation techniques may resultin a negative effect on the classification performance.",Garima Malik,2023/5/16,2023/5/16
2310.00960v1,A pragmatic workflow for research software engineering in computational science,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00960v1,"University research groups in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE)generally lack dedicated funding and personnel for Research SoftwareEngineering (RSE), which, combined with the pressure to maximize the number ofscientific publications, shifts the focus away from sustainable researchsoftware development and reproducible results. The neglect of RSE in CSE atUniversity research groups negatively impacts the scientific output: researchdata - including research software - related to a CSE publication cannot befound, reproduced, or re-used, different ideas are not combined easily into newideas, and published methods must very often be re-implemented to beinvestigated further. This slows down CSE research significantly, resulting inconsiderable losses in time and, consequentially, public funding.  We propose a RSE workflow for Computational Science and Engineering (CSE)that addresses these challenges, that improves the quality of research outputin CSE. Our workflow applies established software engineering practices adaptedfor CSE: software testing, result visualization, and periodical cross-linkingof software with reports/publications and data, timed by milestones in thescientific publication process. The workflow introduces minimal work overhead,crucial for university research groups, and delivers modular and testedsoftware linked to publications whose results can easily be reproduced. Wedefine research software quality from a perspective of a pragmatic researcher:the ability to quickly find the publication, data, and software related to apublished research idea, quickly reproduce results, understand or re-use a CSEmethod, and finally extend the method with new research ideas.",Tomislav Marić,2023/10/2,2023/10/2

However, the definition of uninformativevocabulary is vague, so most algorithms use general knowledge-based stop liststo remove stop words. There is an ongoing debate among academics about theusefulness of stop word elimination, especially in domain-specific settings. Inthis work, we investigate the usefulness of stop word removal in a softwareengineering context. To do this, we replicate and experiment with threesoftware engineering research tools from related work. Additionally, weconstruct a corpus of software engineering domain-related text from 10,000Stack Overflow questions and identify 200 domain-specific stop words usingtraditional information-theoretic methods.

Text-to-image (T2I) software, being one of the most widely used amongthem, is used to synthesize images with simple text input by engaging in across-modal process. However, despite substantial advancements in severalfields, T2I software often encounters defects and erroneous, including omittingfocal entities, low image realism, and mismatched text-image information. Thecross-modal nature of T2I software makes it challenging for traditional testingmethods to detect defects. Lacking test oracles further increases thecomplexity of testing. To address this deficiency, we propose ACTesting, anAutomated Cross-modal Testing Method of Text-to-Image software, the firsttesting method designed specifically for T2I software. We construct testsamples based on entities and relationship triples following the fundamentalprinciple of maintaining consistency in the semantic information to overcomethe cross-modal matching challenges. To address the issue of testing oraclescarcity, we first design the metamorphic relation for T2I software andimplement three types of mutation operators guided by adaptability density. Inthe experiment, we conduct ACTesting on four widely-used T2I software. Theresults show that ACTesting can generate error-revealing tests, reducing thetext-image consistency by up to 20% compared with the baseline. We also conductthe ablation study that effectively showcases the efficacy of each mutationoperator, based on the proposed metamorphic relation. The results demonstratethat ACTesting can identify abnormal behaviors of T2I software effectively.",Siqi Gu,2023/12/20,2023/12/20

However,outages, i.e., severe incidents that always impact multiple services, candramatically affect user experience and incur severe economic losses. Locatingthe root-cause service, i.e., the service that contains the root cause of theoutage, is a crucial step to mitigate the impact of the outage. In currentindustrial practice, this is generally performed in a bootstrap manner andlargely depends on human efforts: the service that directly causes the outageis identified first, and the suspected root cause is traced back manually fromservice to service during diagnosis until the actual root cause is found.Unfortunately, production cloud systems typically contain a large number ofinterdependent services. Such a manual root cause analysis is oftentime-consuming and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose COT, the firstoutage triage approach that considers the global view of service correlations.COT mines the correlations among services from outage diagnosis data. Afterlearning from historical outages, COT can infer the root cause of emerging onesaccurately. We implement COT and evaluate it on a real-world dataset containingone year of data collected from Microsoft Azure, one of the representativecloud computing platforms in the world.

For statically-typed programming language likeJava, developers obtain CFGs by using bytecode-based methods for compilablecode and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based methods for partially uncompilablecode. However, explicit syntax errors during AST construction and implicitsemantic errors caused by bad coding practices can lead to behavioral loss anddeviation of CFGs.To address the issue, we propose a novel approach thatleverages the error-tolerant and understanding ability of pre-trained LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) to generate CFGs. Our approach involves a Chain ofThought (CoT) with four steps: structure hierarchy extraction, nested codeblock extraction, CFG generation of nested code blocks, and fusion of allnested code blocks' CFGs. To address the limitations of the original CoT'ssingle-prompt approach (i.e., completing all steps in a single generativepass), which can result in an ``epic'' prompt with hard-to-control behavior anderror accumulation, we break down the CoT into an AI chain with explicitsub-steps. Each sub-step corresponds to a separate AI-unit, with an effectiveprompt assigned to each unit for interacting with LLMs to accomplish a specificpurpose.Our experiments confirmed that our method outperforms existing CFGtools in terms of node and edge coverage, especially for incomplete orerroneous code.

Building a system from reusable orCommercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components introduces a set of problems, mainlyrelated to compatibility and communication aspects. On one hand, components mayhave incompatible interaction behavior. This might require to restrict thesystem's behavior to a subset of safe behaviors. On the other hand, it might benecessary to enhance the current communication protocol. This might require toaugment the system's behavior to introduce more sophisticated interactionsamong components. We address these problems by enhancing our architecturalapproach which allows for detection and recovery of incompatible interactionsby synthesizing a suitable coordinator. Taking into account the specificationof the system to be assembled and the specification of the protocolenhancements, our tool (called SYNTHESIS) automatically derives, in acompositional way, the glue code for the set of components. The synthesizedglue code implements a software coordinator which avoids incompatibleinteractions and provides a protocol-enhanced version of the composed system.By using an assume-guarantee technique, we are able to check, in acompositional way, if the protocol enhancement is consistent with respect tothe restrictions applied to assure the specified safe behaviors.",Marco Autili,2015/4/28,2015/5/4

This issue concerns the integrity, fairness, and ethical foundationof software applications that depend on the code generated by these models, yetis under-explored in the literature. This paper presents a novel bias testingframework that is specifically designed for code generation tasks. Based onthis framework, we conduct an extensive evaluation of the bias in codegenerated by five state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal that 20.29% to44.93% code functions generated by the models under study are biased whenhandling bias sensitive tasks (i.e., tasks that involve sensitive attributessuch as age and gender). This indicates that the existing LLMs can be unfair incode generation, posing risks of unintended and harmful software behaviors.

2304.07575v2,What Makes Good In-context Demonstrations for Code Intelligence Tasks with LLMs?,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07575v2,"Pre-trained models of source code have gained widespread popularity in manycode intelligence tasks. Recently, with the scaling of the model and corpussize, large language models have shown the ability of in-context learning(ICL). ICL employs task instructions and a few examples as demonstrations, andthen inputs the demonstrations to the language models for making predictions.This new learning paradigm is training-free and has shown impressiveperformance in various natural language processing and code intelligence tasks.However, the performance of ICL heavily relies on the quality ofdemonstrations, e.g., the selected examples. It is important to systematicallyinvestigate how to construct a good demonstration for code-related tasks. Inthis paper, we empirically explore the impact of three key factors on theperformance of ICL in code intelligence tasks: the selection, order, and numberof demonstration examples. We conduct extensive experiments on three codeintelligence tasks including code summarization, bug fixing, and programsynthesis. Our experimental results demonstrate that all the above threefactors dramatically impact the performance of ICL in code intelligence tasks.Additionally, we summarize our findings and provide takeaway suggestions on howto construct effective demonstrations, taking into account these threeperspectives. We also show that a carefully-designed demonstration based on ourfindings can lead to substantial improvements over widely-used demonstrationconstruction methods, e.g., improving BLEU-4, EM, and EM by at least 9.90%,175.96%, and 50.81% on code summarization, bug fixing, and program synthesis,respectively",Shuzheng Gao,2023/4/15,2023/8/8

While prior studies have highlightedthe advantages of fine-tuning LLMs, this process incurs high computationalcosts, making it impractical in resource-scarce environments, particularly formodels with billions of parameters. To address these challenges, previousresearch explored In-Context Learning (ICL) as a strategy to guide the LLMgenerative process with task-specific prompt examples. However, ICL introducesinconveniences, such as the need for designing contextually relevant promptsand the absence of learning task-specific parameters, thereby limitingdownstream task performance. In this context, we foresee Parameter-EfficientFine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques as a promising approach to efficiently specializeLLMs to task-specific data while maintaining reasonable resource consumption.In this paper, we deliver a comprehensive study of PEFT techniques for LLMsunder the automated code generation scenario. Our comprehensive investigationof PEFT techniques for LLMs reveals their superiority and potential over ICLacross a diverse set of LLMs. Additionally, we demonstrate the extendedcapabilities of PEFT, showcasing its ability to learn from two distinctdatasets jointly without compromising performance. Furthermore, our studyhighlights the potential for tuning larger LLMs and significant reductions inmemory usage by combining PEFT with quantization.

Existingstudies have found that ICL is highly dominated by the examples and thus arisesresearch on example selection. However, existing approaches randomly selectexamples or only consider the textual similarity of requirements to retrieve,leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novellearning-based selection approach named LAIL (LLM-Aware In-context Learning)for code generation.

ICL, without updating the parameters of a LLM,it is possible to achieve highly accurate inference based on rules ``in thecontext'' by merely inputting a training data into the prompt. Although ICL isa developing field with many unanswered questions, LLMs themselves serves as ainference model, seemingly realizing inference without explicitly indicate``inductive bias''. On the other hand, a code generation is also a highlightedapplication of LLMs. The accuracy of code generation has dramatically improved,enabling even non-engineers to generate code to perform the desired tasks bycrafting appropriate prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel ``learning''method called an ``Inductive-Bias Learning (IBL)'', which combines thetechniques of ICL and code generation. An idea of IBL is straightforward. LikeICL, IBL inputs a training data into the prompt and outputs a code with anecessary structure for inference (we referred to as ``Code Model'') from a``contextual understanding''. Despite being a seemingly simple approach, IBLencompasses both a ``property of inference without explicit inductive bias''inherent in ICL and a ``readability and explainability'' of the codegeneration. Surprisingly, generated Code Models have been found to achievepredictive accuracy comparable to, and in some cases surpassing, ICL andrepresentative machine learning models.

Although numerouslog parsers have been proposed, their effectiveness on complex log data isoften hindered due to reliance on human-made rules or learning-based modelswith limited training data. The recent rise of powerful large language models(LLMs) shows potential for log parsing due to their extensive pre-trainedknowledge related to code and logging. However, their accuracy is currentlylimited due to the lack of specialized log parsing capabilities. Additionally,the inconsistency of their answers and significant overhead obstruct thepractical implementation of LLM-based log parsing.  To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLMParser, the first practicalLLM-based log parsing framework. LLMParser enables accurate and robust logparsing by leveraging the in-context learning (ICL) capability of the LLM,employing a hierarchical candidate sampling algorithm, and selectinghigh-quality demonstrations. LLMParser also includes a novel adaptive parsingcache component to store and refine the templates generated by the LLM. Thisdesign aids in addressing the inefficiency of LLMs by rapid matching topreviously parsed log templates. LLMParser also adaptively updates thetemplates in the parsing cache to ensure consistent parsed results. Extensiveevaluation on large-scale public datasets demonstrates that LLMParser surpassesthe state-of-the-art methods.

While several virtual assistants for everyday tasks arewell-known (e.g., Siri, Cortana, Alexa), assistants for specialty tasks such assoftware engineering are rarer. One key reason software engineering assistantsare rare is that very few experimental datasets are available and suitable fortraining the AI that is the bedrock of current virtual assistants. In thispaper, we present a set of Wizard of Oz experiments that we designed to build adataset for creating a virtual assistant. Our target is a hypothetical virtualassistant for helping programmers use APIs. In our experiments, we recruited 30professional programmers to complete programming tasks using two APIs. Theprogrammers interacted with a simulated virtual assistant for help - theprogrammers were not aware that the assistant was actually operated by humanexperts. We then annotated the dialogue acts in the corpus along fourdimensions: illocutionary intent, API information type(s), backward-facingfunction, and traceability to specific API components. We observed a diverserange of interactions that will facilitate the development of dialoguestrategies for virtual assistants for API usage.",Zachary Eberhart,2021/6/23,2021/6/23

On the other hand, time available to new hires for productunderstanding continues to be short and getting shorter, given the pressure todeliver more in less time. Constructivist theory views learning as a personalprocess in which the learner constructs new knowledge for themselves. Buildingand refining a mental model is the key way in which they learn, similar to howthe brain operates. This paper presents an approach to improve systemcomprehension process by using a system model that a) acts as a transitionalobject to aid and refine the mental model of the learner, and b) captures thecurrent understanding of the dynamics of the software system in a way that canbe reasoned with and simulated.  We have adapted discrete systems modeling techniques and used a transitionsystem as a lightweight modeling language. Such a model can be used by noviceengineers during their product ramp-up phase to build a model of the softwaresystem that captures their knowledge of the system and aid their mental model.The paper also presents a learning approach in which the learners create andrefine these models iteratively using the available and newly uncoveredknowledge about the software system.

This reveals a need for moving on fromthe more passive strategy of yielding to pressure to a more active one ofdefending software estimates. Therefore, we propose an approach to supportsoftware estimators in acquiring knowledge on how to carry out such defense, byintroducing negotiation principles encapsulated in a set of defense lenses,presented through a digital simulation.

Recently,many approaches have been proposed to automatically recommend method names anddetect inconsistent names. Despite promising, their results are stillsub-optimal considering the three following drawbacks: 1) These models aremostly trained from scratch, learning two different objectives simultaneously.The misalignment between two objectives will negatively affect trainingefficiency and model performance. 2) The enclosing class context is not fullyexploited, making it difficult to learn the abstract function of the method. 3)Current method name consistency checking methods follow a generate-then-compareprocess, which restricts the accuracy as they highly rely on the quality ofgenerated names and face difficulty measuring the semantic consistency.  In this paper, we propose an approach named AUMENA to AUtomate MEthod NAmingtasks with context-aware prompt-tuning. Unlike existing deep learning basedapproaches, our model first learns the contextualized representation(i.e.,class attributes) of PL and NL through the pre-training model, then fullyexploits the capacity and knowledge of large language model with prompt-tuningto precisely detect inconsistent method names and recommend more accuratenames. To better identify semantically consistent names, we model the methodname consistency checking task as a two-class classification problem, avoidingthe limitation of previous similarity-based consistency checking approaches.The experimental results reflect that AUMENA scores 68.6%, 72.0%, 73.6%, 84.7%on four datasets of method name recommendation, surpassing the state-of-the-artbaseline by 8.5%, 18.4%, 11.0%, 12.0%, respectively.

Previous studies mainly modeled APIrecommendation as the recommendation task, which can recommend multiplecandidate APIs for the given query, and developers may not yet be able to findwhat they need. Motivated by the neural machine translation research domain, wecan model this problem as the generation task, which aims to directly generatethe required API for the developer query. After our preliminary investigation,we find the performance of this intuitive approach is not promising. The reasonis that there exists an error when generating the prefixes of the API. However,developers may know certain API prefix information during actual development inmost cases. Therefore, we model this problem as the automatic completion taskand propose a novel approach APICom based on prompt learning, which cangenerate API related to the query according to the prompts (i.e., API prefixinformation). Moreover, the effectiveness of APICom highly depends on thequality of the training dataset.

The functionalities of recent LLMs can be flexibly modulated vianatural language prompts. This renders them susceptible to targeted adversarialprompting, e.g., Prompt Injection (PI) attacks enable attackers to overrideoriginal instructions and employed controls. So far, it was assumed that theuser is directly prompting the LLM. But, what if it is not the user prompting?We argue that LLM-Integrated Applications blur the line between data andinstructions. We reveal new attack vectors, using Indirect Prompt Injection,that enable adversaries to remotely (without a direct interface) exploitLLM-integrated applications by strategically injecting prompts into data likelyto be retrieved. We derive a comprehensive taxonomy from a computer securityperspective to systematically investigate impacts and vulnerabilities,including data theft, worming, information ecosystem contamination, and othernovel security risks. We demonstrate our attacks' practical viability againstboth real-world systems, such as Bing's GPT-4 powered Chat and code-completionengines, and synthetic applications built on GPT-4. We show how processingretrieved prompts can act as arbitrary code execution, manipulate theapplication's functionality, and control how and if other APIs are called.Despite the increasing integration and reliance on LLMs, effective mitigationsof these emerging threats are currently lacking. By raising awareness of thesevulnerabilities and providing key insights into their implications, we aim topromote the safe and responsible deployment of these powerful models and thedevelopment of robust defenses that protect users and systems from potentialattacks.",Kai Greshake,2023/2/23,2023/5/5

Alternative methods, like sending data to the model's provider fortraining, intensify these privacy issues facing an untrusted provider. In thispaper, we present a novel solution called Differentially-Private Offsite PromptTuning (DP-OPT) to address this challenge.

However,despite the demonstrated representational power of such models, interactingwith them has historically been constrained to specific task settings, limitingtheir general applicability. Many of these limitations were recently overcomewith the introduction of ChatGPT, a language model created by OpenAI andtrained to operate as a conversational agent, enabling it to answer questionsand respond to a wide variety of commands from end users.

However, given the nascent nature of these tools, we currentlylack fundamental knowledge related to how well they perform in differenteducational settings, and the potential promise (or danger) that they mightpose to traditional forms of instruction. As such, in this paper, we examinehow well ChatGPT performs when tasked with answering common questions in apopular software testing curriculum.

2204.09368v1,BugListener: Identifying and Synthesizing Bug Reports from Collaborative Live Chats,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09368v1,"In community-based software development, developers frequently rely onlive-chatting to discuss emergent bugs/errors they encounter in dailydevelopment tasks. However, it remains a challenging task to accurately recordsuch knowledge due to the noisy nature of interleaved dialogs in live chatdata. In this paper, we first formulate the task of identifying andsynthesizing bug reports from community live chats, and propose a novelapproach, named BugListener, to address the challenges. Specifically,BugListener automates three sub-tasks: 1) Disentangle the dialogs from massivechat logs by using a Feed-Forward neural network; 2) Identify the bug-reportdialogs from separated dialogs by modeling the original dialog to thegraph-structured dialog and leveraging the graph neural network to learn thecontextual information; 3) Synthesize the bug reports by utilizing the TextCNNmodel and Transfer Learning network to classify the sentences into threegroups: observed behaviors (OB), expected behaviors (EB), and steps toreproduce the bug (SR). BugListener is evaluated on six open source projects.The results show that: for bug report identification, BugListener achieves theaverage F1 of 74.21%, improving the best baseline by 10.37%; and for bug reportsynthesis task, BugListener could classify the OB, EB, and SR sentences withthe F1 of 67.37%, 87.14%, and 65.03%, improving the best baselines by 7.21%,7.38%, 5.30%, respectively. A human evaluation also confirms the effectivenessof BugListener in generating relevant and accurate bug reports. Thesedemonstrate the significant potential of applying BugListener incommunity-based software development, for promoting bug discovery and qualityimprovement.",Lin Shi,2022/4/20,2022/4/20

However, little work has been done in thisregard. To bridge the gap, this paper reports a first comprehensive empiricalstudy on developers' live chat, investigating when they interact, whatcommunity structures look like, which topics are discussed, and how theyinteract. We manually analyze 749 dialogs in the first phase, followed by anautomated analysis of over 173K dialogs in the second phase. We find thatdevelopers tend to converse more often on weekdays, especially on Wednesdaysand Thursdays (UTC), that there are three common community structures observed,that developers tend to discuss topics such as API usages and errors, and thatsix dialog interaction patterns are identified in the live chat communities.Based on the findings, we provide recommendations for individual developers andOSS communities, highlight desired features for platform vendors, and shedlight on future research directions.

Therefore, community live chatscontain rich sets of information for reported issues and their correspondingsolutions, which can be quite useful for knowledge sharing and future reuse ifextracted and restored in time. However, it remains challenging to accuratelymine such knowledge due to the noisy nature of interleaved dialogs in live chatdata. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of issue-solution pairextraction from developer live chat data, and propose an automated approach,named ISPY, based on natural language processing and deep learning techniqueswith customized enhancements, to address the problem. Specifically, ISPYautomates three tasks: 1) Disentangle live chat logs, employing a feedforwardneural network to disentangle a conversation history into separate dialogsautomatically; 2) Detect dialogs discussing issues, using a novel convolutionalneural network (CNN), which consists of a BERT-based utterance embedding layer,a context-aware dialog embedding layer, and an output layer; 3) Extractappropriate utterances and combine them as corresponding solutions, based onthe same CNN structure but with different feeding inputs. To evaluate ISPY, wecompare it with six baselines, utilizing a dataset with 750 dialogs including171 issue-solution pairs and evaluate ISPY from eight open source communities.The results show that, for issue-detection, our approach achieves the F1 of76%, and outperforms all baselines by 30%.

At the core of this paradigm lies ChatDev, a virtual chat-poweredsoftware development company that mirrors the established waterfall model,meticulously dividing the development process into four distinct chronologicalstages: designing, coding, testing, and documenting.

1204.4224v3,Software Mutational Robustness,http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4224v3,"Neutral landscapes and mutational robustness are believed to be importantenablers of evolvability in biology. We apply these concepts to software,defining mutational robustness to be the fraction of random mutations thatleave a program's behavior unchanged. Test cases are used to measure programbehavior and mutation operators are taken from genetic programming. Althoughsoftware is often viewed as brittle, with small changes leading to catastrophicchanges in behavior, our results show surprising robustness in the face ofrandom software mutations.  The paper describes empirical studies of the mutational robustness of 22programs, including 14 production software projects, the Siemens benchmarks,and 4 specially constructed programs. We find that over 30% of random mutationsare neutral with respect to their test suite. The results hold across allclasses of programs, for mutations at both the source code and assemblyinstruction levels, across various programming languages, and are only weaklyrelated to test suite coverage. We conclude that mutational robustness is aninherent property of software, and that neutral variants (i.e., those that passthe test suite) often fulfill the program's original purpose or specification.  Based on these results, we conjecture that neutral mutations can be leveragedas a mechanism for generating software diversity. We demonstrate this idea bygenerating a population of neutral program variants and showing that thevariants automatically repair unknown bugs with high probability. Neutrallandscapes also provide a partial explanation for recent results that useevolutionary computation to automatically repair software bugs.",Eric Schulte,2012/4/18,2013/6/27

Although existing testing techniques for general text-to-textsoftware can detect some robustness issues, they are limited in effectivenessdue to ignoring the characteristics of code generation systems. In this work,we propose a novel technique COCO to test the robustness of code generationsystems. It exploits the usage scenario of code generation systems to make theoriginal programming instruction more concrete by incorporating features knownto be contained in the original code. A robust system should maintain codesemantics for the concretized instruction, and COCO detects robustnessinconsistencies when it does not. We evaluated COCO on eight advanced codegeneration systems, including commercial tools such as Copilot and ChatGPT,using two widely-used datasets. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness ofCOCO in testing the robustness of code generation systems, outperforming twotechniques adopted from general text-to-text software testing by 466.66% and104.02%, respectively. Furthermore, concretized instructions generated by COCOcan help reduce robustness inconsistencies by 18.35% to 53.91% throughfine-tuning.",Ming Yan,2023/8/25,2023/8/25

To harness visual concepts from target imageswithout prompt engineering, current approaches largely rely on embeddinginversion by optimizing and then mapping them to pseudo-tokens. However,working with such high-dimensional vector representations is challengingbecause they lack semantics and interpretability, and only allow simple vectoroperations when using them. Instead, this work focuses on inverting thediffusion model to obtain interpretable language prompts directly. Thechallenge of doing this lies in the fact that the resulting optimizationproblem is fundamentally discrete and the space of prompts is exponentiallylarge; this makes using standard optimization techniques, such as stochasticgradient descent, difficult. To this end, we utilize a delayed projectionscheme to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space in themodel. Further, we leverage the findings that different timesteps of thediffusion process cater to different levels of detail in an image. The later,noisy, timesteps of the forward diffusion process correspond to the semanticinformation, and therefore, prompt inversion in this range provides tokensrepresentative of the image semantics. We show that our approach can identifysemantically interpretable and meaningful prompts for a target image which canbe used to synthesize diverse images with similar content.

AceCoder contains two novelmechanisms (i.e., guided code generation and example retrieval) to solve thesechallenges. (1) Guided code generation asks LLMs first to analyze requirementsand output an intermediate preliminary (e.g., test cases). The preliminary isused to clarify requirements and tell LLMs ""what to write"". (2) Exampleretrieval selects similar programs as examples in prompts, which provide lotsof relevant content (e.g., algorithms, APIs) and teach LLMs ""how to write"".

In this paper, we showthat we can explain such performance well via recourse to classical PAC-Bayesbounds. Specifically, we show that the discrete nature of prompts, combinedwith a PAC-Bayes prior given by a language model, results in generalizationbounds that are remarkably tight by the standards of the literature: forinstance, the generalization bound of an ImageNet classifier is often within afew percentage points of the true test error. We demonstrate empirically thatthis holds for existing handcrafted prompts and prompts generated throughsimple greedy search.

Much attention has been paid to the technicalpotential; relatively little attention has been paid to the softwareengineering process required to bring research-based machine learningtechniques into practical utility. Technology companies have supported theengineering community through machine learning frameworks such as TensorFLowand PyTorch, but the details of how to engineer complex machine learning modelsin these frameworks have remained hidden.  To promote best practices within the engineering community, academicinstitutions and Google have partnered to launch a Special Interest Group onMachine Learning Models (SIGMODELS) whose goal is to develop exemplaryimplementations of prominent machine learning models in community locationssuch as the TensorFlow Model Garden (TFMG). The purpose of this report is todefine a process for reproducing a state-of-the-art machine learning model at alevel of quality suitable for inclusion in the TFMG. We define the engineeringprocess and elaborate on each step, from paper analysis to model release.

The control of the transient phases is traditionallyperformed in open-loop due to highly nonlinear system dynamics. This situationis unsatisfactory, in particular for reusable engines. The open-loop controlsystem cannot provide optimal engine performance due to external disturbancesor the degeneration of engine components over time. In this paper, we study adeep reinforcement learning approach for optimal control of a genericgas-generator engine's continuous start-up phase. It is shown that the learnedpolicy can reach different steady-state operating points and convincingly adaptto changing system parameters. A quantitative comparison with carefully tunedopen-loop sequences and PID controllers is included. The deep reinforcementlearning controller achieves the highest performance and requires only minimalcomputational effort to calculate the control action, which is a big advantageover approaches that require online optimization, such as model predictivecontrol. control.",Günther Waxenegger-Wilfing,2020/6/19,2020/6/19

In order to reduce the number of dynamometer testsrequired for calibrating modern engines, a large-scale simulation-drivenmachine learning approach is presented in this work. A parallel, fast, robust,physics-based reduced-order engine simulator is used to obtain performance andemission characteristics of engines over a wide range of control parametersunder various transient driving conditions (drive cycles). We scale thesimulation up to 3,906 nodes of the Theta supercomputer at the ArgonneLeadership Computing Facility to generate data required to train a machinelearning model. The trained model is then used to predict various engineparameters of interest. Our results show that a deep-neural-network-basedsurrogate model achieves high accuracy for various engine parameters such asexhaust temperature, exhaust pressure, nitric oxide, and engine torque. Oncetrained, the deep-neural-network-based surrogate model is fast for inference:it requires about 16 micro sec for predicting the engine performance andemissions for a single design configuration compared with about 0.5 s perconfiguration with the engine simulator.

Requirements analysis involves analyzingthe problem and solutions spaces. In this paper, we describe a method toformulate interrogative questions for effective requirements elicitation basedon the lexical and semantic principles of the English language interrogatives,and propose a pattern to organize stakeholder viewpoint concerns for betterrequirements analysis.

Most of the previous requirements elicitation studies included six out of theseven English language interrogatives 'what', 'where', 'when', 'who', 'why',and 'how' (denoted by W5H) and did not propose any order in the interrogatives.We show that extending the set of six interrogatives with 'which' (denoted byW6H) improves the generation and formulation of questions for requirementselicitation and facilitates better requirements analysis via arrangingstakeholder views. We discuss the interdependencies among interrogatives (forrequirements engineer to consider while eliciting the requirements) and suggestan order for the set of W6H interrogatives.

Objective: We aim atunderstanding the value of interactive causality extraction based on syntacticcriteria for the context of requirements engineering. Method: We developed aprototype of a system for automatic causality extraction and evaluate it byapplying it to a set of publicly available requirements artifacts, determiningwhether the automatic extraction reduces the manual effort of requirementsformalization. Result: During the evaluation we analyzed 4457 natural languagesentences from 18 requirements documents, 558 of which were causal (12.52%).The best evaluation of a requirements document provided an automatic extractionof 48.57% cause-effect graphs on average, which demonstrates the feasibility ofthe approach.

Conversely, it can be effective inglobal engines and weak in domestic engines. In addition, log-based querysuggestions require many search logs, which makes them difficult to constructoutside of a large search engine.

2302.04723v2,Zero-Shot Learning for Requirements Classification: An Exploratory Study,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04723v2,"Context: Requirements engineering researchers have been experimenting withmachine learning and deep learning approaches for a range of RE tasks, such asrequirements classification, requirements tracing, ambiguity detection, andmodelling. However, most of today's ML/DL approaches are based on supervisedlearning techniques, meaning that they need to be trained using a large amountof task-specific labelled training data. This constraint poses an enormouschallenge to RE researchers, as the lack of labelled data makes it difficultfor them to fully exploit the benefit of advanced ML/DL technologies.Objective: This paper addresses this problem by showing how a zero-shotlearning approach can be used for requirements classification without using anylabelled training data. We focus on the classification task because many REtasks can be framed as classification problems. Method: The ZSL approach usedin our study employs contextual word-embeddings and transformer-based languagemodels. We demonstrate this approach through a series of experiments to performthree classification tasks: (1)FR/NFR: classification functional requirementsvs non-functional requirements; (2)NFR: identification of NFR classes;(3)Security: classification of security vs non-security requirements. Results:The study shows that the ZSL approach achieves an F1 score of 0.66 for theFR/NFR task. For the NFR task, the approach yields F1~0.72-0.80, consideringthe most frequent classes. For the Security task, F1~0.66. All of theaforementioned F1 scores are achieved with zero-training efforts. Conclusion:This study demonstrates the potential of ZSL for requirements classification.An important implication is that it is possible to have very little or notraining data to perform classification tasks. The proposed approach thuscontributes to the solution of the long-standing problem of data shortage inRE.",Waad Alhoshan,2023/2/9,2023/3/15

This paper presentsa novel summarization-guided approach for automatically generating assertstatements. To derive generic representations for natural language (i.e.,summarization) and programming language (i.e., test prefixes and focalmethods), we leverage a pre-trained language model as the referencearchitecture and fine-tune it on the task of assert statement generation.

1807.02340v2,Testing Untestable Neural Machine Translation: An Industrial Case,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02340v2,"Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been widely adopted recently due to itsadvantages compared with the traditional Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).However, an NMT system still often produces translation failures due to thecomplexity of natural language and sophistication in designing neural networks.While in-house black-box system testing based on reference translations (i.e.,examples of valid translations) has been a common practice for NMT qualityassurance, an increasingly critical industrial practice, named in-vivo testing,exposes unseen types or instances of translation failures when real users areusing a deployed industrial NMT system. To fill the gap of lacking test oraclefor in-vivo testing of an NMT system, in this paper, we propose a new approachfor automatically identifying translation failures, without requiring referencetranslations for a translation task; our approach can directly serve as a testoracle for in-vivo testing. Our approach focuses on properties of naturallanguage translation that can be checked systematically and uses informationfrom both the test inputs (i.e., the texts to be translated) and the testoutputs (i.e., the translations under inspection) of the NMT system. Ourevaluation conducted on real-world datasets shows that our approach caneffectively detect targeted property violations as translation failures.

2312.04068v1,Making Translators Privacy-aware on the User's Side,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04068v1,"We propose PRISM to enable users of machine translation systems to preservethe privacy of data on their own initiative. There is a growing demand to applymachine translation systems to data that require privacy protection. Whileseveral machine translation engines claim to prioritize privacy, the extent andspecifics of such protection are largely ambiguous. First, there is often alack of clarity on how and to what degree the data is protected. Even ifservice providers believe they have sufficient safeguards in place,sophisticated adversaries might still extract sensitive information. Second,vulnerabilities may exist outside of these protective measures, such as withincommunication channels, potentially leading to data leakage. As a result, usersare hesitant to utilize machine translation engines for data demanding highlevels of privacy protection, thereby missing out on their benefits. PRISMresolves this problem. Instead of relying on the translation service to keepdata safe, PRISM provides the means to protect data on the user's side. Thisapproach ensures that even machine translation engines with inadequate privacymeasures can be used securely. For platforms already equipped with privacysafeguards, PRISM acts as an additional protection layer, reinforcing theirsecurity furthermore. PRISM adds these privacy features without significantlycompromising translation accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate theeffectiveness of PRISM using real-world translators, T5 and ChatGPT(GPT-3.5-turbo), and the datasets with two languages. PRISM effectivelybalances privacy protection with translation accuracy.",Ryoma Sato,2023/12/7,2023/12/7

In order to diagnosegeneral errors, this paper proposes a new Bilingual Translation Pair Generationbased Behavior Testing (BTPGBT) framework for conducting behavioral testing ofMT systems. The core idea of BTPGBT is to employ a novel bilingual translationpair generation (BTPG) approach that automates the construction of high-qualitytest cases and their pseudoreferences.

A major challenge todevise such a translator is the lack of publicly available informalrequirements and formal specifications. We propose a two-step workflow toaddress this challenge. We first design a grammar-based generation technique ofsynthetic data, where each output is a random STL formula and its associatedset of possible English translations. In the second step, we use astate-of-the-art transformer-based neural translation technique, to train anaccurate attentional translator of English to STL.

Simulated training offers anappealing alternative, but ensuring that policies trained in simulation cantransfer effectively into the real world requires additional machinery.Simulations may not match reality, and typically bridging thesimulation-to-reality gap requires domain knowledge and task-specificengineering. We can automate this process by employing generative models totranslate simulated images into realistic ones. However, this sort oftranslation is typically task-agnostic, in that the translated images may notpreserve all features that are relevant to the task. In this paper, weintroduce the RL-scene consistency loss for image translation, which ensuresthat the translation operation is invariant with respect to the Q-valuesassociated with the image. This allows us to learn a task-aware translation.Incorporating this loss into unsupervised domain translation, we obtainRL-CycleGAN, a new approach for simulation-to-real-world transfer forreinforcement learning.

Finally, thetwo types of answer heuristics are jointly encoded into a formatted prompt tofacilitate the LLM's understanding of both the image and question, thusgenerating a more accurate answer. By incorporating the state-of-the-art LLMGPT-3, Prophet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods onfour challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets.

Scientists studying theseprocesses have identified various pathways responsible for drug metabolism, andsignal transduction, etc.  Newer techniques and speed improvements have resulted in deeper knowledgeabout these pathways, resulting in refined models that tend to be large andcomplex, making it difficult for a person to remember all aspects of it. Thus,computer models are needed to analyze them. We want to build such a system thatallows modeling of biological systems and pathways in such a way that we cananswer questions about them.  Many existing models focus on structural and/or factoid questions, usingsurface-level knowledge that does not require understanding the underlyingmodel. We believe these are not the kind of questions that a biologist may asksomeone to test their understanding of the biological processes. We want oursystem to answer the kind of questions a biologist may ask. Such questionsappear in early college level text books.

As large-language models learn from all kinds of text merely asa sequence of characters/tokens, these are yet to generate text that embodiesexplicit engineering design facts. Existing ontological design theories areless likely to guide the large-language models whose applications are currentlylimited to ideation and learning purposes. In this article, we explicateengineering design knowledge as knowledge graphs from a large sample of 33,881patent documents.

However, contract negotiations mainly occuramong the legal counsel of the parties involved. The participation of non-legalstakeholders, including requirement analysts, engineers, and solutionarchitects, whose primary responsibility lies in ensuring the seamlessimplementation of contractual terms, is often indirect and inadequate.Consequently, a significant number of sentences in contractual clauses, thoughlegally accurate, can appear unfair from an implementation perspective tonon-legal stakeholders. This perception poses a problem since requirementsindicated in the clauses are obligatory and can involve punitive measures andpenalties if not implemented as committed in the contract. Therefore, theidentification of potentially unfair clauses in contracts becomes crucial. Inthis work, we conduct an empirical study to analyze the perspectives ofdifferent stakeholders regarding contractual fairness. We then investigate theability of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to identify unfairness incontractual sentences by comparing chain of thought prompting andsemi-supervised fine-tuning approaches. Using BERT-based fine-tuning, weachieved an accuracy of 84% on a dataset consisting of proprietary contracts.It outperformed chain of thought prompting using Vicuna-13B by a margin of 9%.",Anmol Singhal,2023/12/3,2023/12/3

Now, we aim to investigate whether fine-tuning a model for thegeneration of Prolog codes, a logic language, and subsequently passing thesecodes to a compiler can further improve accuracy. Consequently, we employchain-of-thought to fine-tune LLaMA7B as a baseline model and develop otherfine-tuned LLaMA7B models for the generation of Prolog code, Prolog code +chain-of-thought, and chain-of-thought + Prolog code, respectively.

This means they canfall short in tasks that require exploration, strategic lookahead, or whereinitial decisions play a pivotal role. To surmount these challenges, weintroduce a new framework for language model inference, Tree of Thoughts (ToT),which generalizes over the popular Chain of Thought approach to promptinglanguage models, and enables exploration over coherent units of text (thoughts)that serve as intermediate steps toward problem solving. ToT allows LMs toperform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoningpaths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as wellas looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices. Ourexperiments show that ToT significantly enhances language models'problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring non-trivial planningor search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords.

We measure how often models can correctly answer allsub-problems but not generate the overall solution, a ratio we call thecompositionality gap. We evaluate this ratio by asking multi-hop questions withanswers that require composing multiple facts unlikely to have been observedtogether during pretraining. In the GPT-3 family of models, as model sizeincreases we show that the single-hop question answering performance improvesfaster than the multi-hop performance does, therefore the compositionality gapdoes not decrease. This surprising result suggests that while more powerfulmodels memorize and recall more factual knowledge, they show no correspondingimprovement in their ability to perform this kind of compositional reasoning.  We then demonstrate how elicitive prompting (such as chain of thought)narrows the compositionality gap by reasoning explicitly. We present a newmethod, self-ask, that further improves on chain of thought. In our method, themodel explicitly asks itself (and answers) follow-up questions before answeringthe initial question.

Chain of Thought is a simple and effective approximation tohuman reasoning process and has been proven useful for natural languageprocessing (NLP) tasks.

Chain-of-Thought and itssimilar approaches incorporate the reasoning chain in the form of textualcontext, but it is still an open question how to effectively leverage tabulardata in the reasoning chain. We propose the Chain-of-Table framework, wheretabular data is explicitly used in the reasoning chain as a proxy forintermediate thoughts. Specifically, we guide LLMs using in-context learning toiteratively generate operations and update the table to represent a tabularreasoning chain. LLMs can therefore dynamically plan the next operation basedon the results of the previous ones. This continuous evolution of the tableforms a chain, showing the reasoning process for a given tabular problem.

The process is one-shot in the sense that decisions aremade during one time step and that they are final. The term shallow refers to aone-layer hierarchy of the process. Specifically, we assume that the systemsengineer has already decomposed the problem in subsystems, and that eachsubsystem is assigned to a different subsystem engineer. Each subsystemengineer works independently to maximize their own expected payoff. The goal ofthe systems engineer is to maximize the system-level payoff by incentivizingthe subsystem engineers. We restrict our attention to requirement-basedsystem-level payoffs, i.e., the systems engineer makes a profit only if all thedesign requirements are met. We illustrate the model using the design of anEarth-orbiting satellite system where the systems engineer determines theoptimum incentive structures and requirements for two subsystems: thepropulsion subsystem and the power subsystem. The model enables the analysis ofa systems engineer's decisions about optimal passed-down requirements andincentives for sub-system engineers under different levels of task difficultyand associated costs. Sample results, for the case of risk-neutral systems andsubsystems engineers, show that it is not always in the best interest of thesystems engineer to pass down the true requirements. As expected, the modelpredicts that for small to moderate task uncertainties the optimal requirementsare higher than the true ones, effectively eliminating the probability offailure for the systems engineer. In contrast, the model predicts that forlarge task uncertainties the optimal requirements should be smaller than thetrue ones in order to lure the subsystem engineers into participation.",Salar Safarkhani,2019/3/16,2019/3/16

The value of$\gamma$ required to match the observed $M^*_{100}-M_{500}$ is $\gamma=3$ at$z=0$, but there are hints that it might be a function of redshift and halomass. This result indicates that the distribution of the ICL is moreconcentrated than the dark matter one, but less concentrated than previouslyfound by other studies. We suggest that a modified version of the NFW is a gooddescription of the distribution of the diffuse light in groups and clusters,which makes the ICL a reliable tracer of the dark matter, in good agreementwith recent observational findings.",Emanuele Contini,2020/5/28,2020/8/21

However, the ICL models that can solve ordinary cases are hardlyextended to solve more complex tasks by processing the demonstration examplesonce. This single-turn ICL is incoordinate with the decision making process ofhumans by learning from analogy. In this paper, we propose an effective andefficient two-stage framework to boost ICL in LLMs by exploiting a dual formbetween Transformer attention and gradient descent-based optimization.Concretely, we divide the ICL process into ""Deep-Thinking"" and inferencestages. The ""Deep-Thinking"" stage performs iterative forward optimization ofdemonstrations, which is expected to boost the reasoning abilities of LLMs attest time by ""thinking"" demonstrations multiple times. It produces accumulatedmeta-gradients by manipulating the Key-Value matrices in the self-attentionmodules of the Transformer. Then, the inference stage only takes the test queryas input without concatenating demonstrations and applies the learnedmeta-gradients through attention for output prediction. In this way,demonstrations are not required during the inference stage since they arealready learned and stored in the definitive meta-gradients. LLMs can beeffectively and efficiently adapted to downstream tasks. Extensive experimentson ten classification and multiple-choice datasets show that our methodachieves substantially better performance than standard ICL in terms of bothaccuracy and efficiency.",Jiaxi Yang,2023/5/22,2023/5/30

The measure required an accurate removal of the galaxieslight within $\sim 200$ kpc from the center. The residual background intensityhas then been integrated in circular apertures to derive the average ICLintensity profile. The latter shows an approximate exponential decline asexpected from theoretical cold dark matter models. The radial profile of theICL over the galaxies intensity ratio (ICL fraction) is increasing withdecreasing radius but near the cluster center it starts to bend and thendecreases where the overlap of the halos of the brightest cluster galaxiesbecomes dominant. Theoretical expectations in a simplified CDM scenario showthat the ICL fraction profile can be estimated from the stripped over galaxystellar mass ratio in the cluster. It is possible to show that the latterquantity is almost independent of the properties of the individual hostgalaxies but mainly depends on the average cluster properties. The predictedICL fraction profile is thus very sensitive to the assumed CDM profile, totalmass and concentration parameter of the cluster. Adopting values very similarto those derived from the most recent lensing analysis in CL0024+17 we find agood agreement with the observed ICL fraction profile. The galaxy counts in thecluster core have then been compared with that derived from composite clustersamples in larger volumes, up to the clusters virial radius. The galaxy countsin the CL0024+17 core appear flatter and the amount of bending respect to theaverage cluster galaxy counts imply a loss of total emissivity in broadagreement with the measured ICL fraction.",E.

In thispaper, we develop a novel semi-parametric language model architecture,Knowledge-in-Context (KiC), which empowers a parametric text-to-text languagemodel with a knowledge-rich external memory. Specifically, the external memorycontains six different types of knowledge: entity, dictionary, commonsense,event, script, and causality knowledge. For each input instance, the KiC modeladaptively selects a knowledge type and retrieves the most helpful pieces ofknowledge. The input instance along with its knowledge augmentation is fed intoa text-to-text model (e.g., T5) to generate the output answer, where both theinput and the output are in natural language forms after prompting.Interestingly, we find that KiC can be identified as a specialmixture-of-experts (MoE) model, where the knowledge selector plays the role ofa router that is used to determine the sequence-to-expert assignment in MoE.This key observation inspires us to develop a novel algorithm for training KiCwith an instance-adaptive knowledge selector. As a knowledge-richsemi-parametric language model, KiC only needs a much smaller parametric partto achieve superior zero-shot performance on unseen tasks. By evaluating on 40+different tasks, we show that KiC_Large with 770M parameters easily outperformslarge language models (LMs) that are 4-39x larger by a large margin.

In literature, one branch of methods adapts CLIP bylearning prompts using visual information. While effective, most of these worksrequire labeled data which is not practical, and often struggle to generalizetowards new datasets due to over-fitting on the source data. An alternativeapproach resorts to training-free methods by generating class descriptions fromlarge language models (LLMs) and perform prompt ensembling. However, thesemethods often generate class specific prompts that cannot be transferred toother classes, which incur higher costs by generating LLM descriptions for eachclass separately. In this work, we propose to combine the strengths of theseboth streams of methods by learning prompts using only text data derived fromLLMs. As supervised training of prompts is not trivial due to absence ofimages, we develop a training approach that allows prompts to extract richcontextual knowledge from LLM data. Moreover, with LLM contextual data mappedwithin the learned prompts, it enables zero-shot transfer of prompts to newclasses and datasets potentially cutting the LLM prompt engineering cost.

However, they aresensitive to the variation of input text prompts and need a selection of prompttemplates to achieve satisfactory performance. Recently, various methods havebeen proposed to dynamically learn the prompts as the textual inputs to avoidthe requirements of laboring hand-crafted prompt engineering in the fine-tuningprocess. We notice that these methods are suboptimal in two aspects. First, theprompts of the vision and language branches in these methods are usuallyseparated or uni-directionally correlated. Thus, the prompts of both branchesare not fully correlated and may not provide enough guidance to align therepresentations of both branches. Second, it's observed that most previousmethods usually achieve better performance on seen classes but causeperformance degeneration on unseen classes compared to CLIP.

Specifically, we disentangle perception and reasoningfrom a monolithic model. The neural visual perception frontend predictsobjects' attributes, later aggregated by a scene inference engine to produce aprobabilistic scene representation. In the symbolic logical reasoning backend,the PrAE learner uses the representation to abduce the hidden rules. An answeris predicted by executing the rules on the probabilistic representation.

We use CrewResource Management techniques to identify requirements and behaviors for safehuman-machine teaming behaviors. We provide a methodology to verify that an IASmeets its requirements. We apply the methodology to a case study in Urban AirMobility, which includes two contingency scenarios: unreliable sensor andaborted landing. For this case study, we implement an IAS agent in the Soarlanguage that acts as a copilot for the selected contingency scenarios andperforms takeoff and landing preparation, while the pilot maintains finaldecision authority. We develop a formal human-machine team architecture modelin the Architectural Analysis and Design Language (AADL), with operator and IASrequirements formalized in the Assume Guarantee REasoning Environment (AGREE)Annex to AADL. We formally verify safety requirements for the human-machineteam given the requirements on the IAS and operator. We develop an automatedtranslator from Soar to the nuXmv model checking language and formally verifythat the IAS agent satisfies its requirements using nuXmv.

A primary motivation for `getting things right' in these earlydesign stages is that altering the design is significantly less costly and moreeffective than when hardware and software have already been developed.Engineering cyber-physical systems requires the construction of severaldifferent types of models, each representing a different view, which includestakeholder requirements, system behavior, and the system architecture.Furthermore, each of these models can be represented at different levels ofabstraction. Formal reasoning has improved the precision and expanded theavailable types of analysis in assuring correctness of requirements, behaviors,and architectures. However, each is usually modeled in distinct formalisms andcorresponding tools. Currently, this disparity means that a system designermust manually check that the different models are in agreement. Manuallyediting and checking models is error prone, time consuming, and sensitive toany changes in the design of the models themselves. Wiring diagrams and relatedtheory provide a means for formally organizing these different but relatedmodeling views, resulting in a compositional modeling language forcyber-physical systems. Such a categorical language can make concrete therelationship between different model views, thereby managing complexity,allowing hierarchical decomposition of system models, and formally provingconsistency between models.",Georgios Bakirtzis,2021/1/26,2021/1/26

In particular, we focus on the case in which theexternal shock develops early in the evolution, at a radius that is smallerthan the internal shock one. We find that bursts in such high densityenvironments are likely characterized by a single, long emission episode thatis due to the superposition of individual pulses, with a characteristic hard tosoft evolution irrespective of the light curve luminosity. While multi-pulselight curves are not impossible, they would require the central engine to godormant for a long time before re-igniting.

While there has beensome success at circumventing these measures -- so-called ""jailbreaks"" againstLLMs -- these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittlein practice. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack methodthat causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors.Specifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide rangeof queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize theprobability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather thanrefusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, ourapproach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination ofgreedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over pastautomatic prompt generation methods.  Surprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approachare quite transferable, including to black-box, publicly released LLMs.Specifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e.,queries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well asmultiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B).

Neuromorphic hardware implementingSpiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are particularly attractive in this regard, astheir real-time, event-based, local computing paradigm makes them suitable foredge implementations and fast learning. However, the long and iterativelearning that characterizes state-of-the-art SNN training is incompatible withthe physical nature and real-time operation of neuromorphic hardware. Bi-levellearning, such as meta-learning is increasingly used in deep learning toovercome these limitations. In this work, we demonstrate gradient-basedmeta-learning in SNNs using the surrogate gradient method that approximates thespiking threshold function for gradient estimations. Because surrogategradients can be made twice differentiable, well-established, and effectivesecond-order gradient meta-learning methods such as Model Agnostic MetaLearning (MAML) can be used. We show that SNNs meta-trained using MAML match orexceed the performance of conventional ANNs meta-trained with MAML onevent-based meta-datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the specific advantagesthat accrue from meta-learning: fast learning without the requirement of highprecision weights or gradients. Our results emphasize how meta-learningtechniques can become instrumental for deploying neuromorphic learningtechnologies on real-world problems.",Kenneth Stewart,2022/1/26,2022/1/26

We study a moresample-efficient alternative: using pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) aszero-shot reward models (RMs) to specify tasks via natural language. We proposea natural and general approach to using VLMs as reward models, which we callVLM-RMs. We use VLM-RMs based on CLIP to train a MuJoCo humanoid to learncomplex tasks without a manually specified reward function, such as kneeling,doing the splits, and sitting in a lotus position. For each of these tasks, weonly provide a single sentence text prompt describing the desired task withminimal prompt engineering. We provide videos of the trained agents at:https://sites.google.com/view/vlm-rm. We can improve performance by providing asecond ``baseline'' prompt and projecting out parts of the CLIP embedding spaceirrelevant to distinguish between goal and baseline. Further, we find a strongscaling effect for VLM-RMs: larger VLMs trained with more compute and data arebetter reward models. The failure modes of VLM-RMs we encountered are allrelated to known capability limitations of current VLMs, such as limitedspatial reasoning ability or visually unrealistic environments that are faroff-distribution for the VLM. We find that VLM-RMs are remarkably robust aslong as the VLM is large enough.

Using TOT technique as a measure of energy loss insteadof charge integration methods significantly reduces the signals readout cost bycombining the time and energy information. Therefore, this approach canpotentially be used in J-PET tomograph which is build from plasticscintillators characterized by fast light signals. The drawback in adoptingthis technique is lying in the non-linear correlation between input energy lossand TOT of the signal. The main motivation behind this work is to develop therelationship between TOT and energy loss and validate it with the J-PETtomograph.  The experiment was performed using the $^{22}$Na beta emitter source placedin the center of the J-PET tomograph. One can obtain primary photons of twodifferent energies: 511 keV photon from the annihilation of positron (directannihilation or through the formation of para-Positronim atom or pick-offprocess of ortho-Positronium atoms), and 1275 keV prompt photon. This allows tostudy the correlation between TOT values and energy loss for energy range up to1000 keV. As the photon interacts dominantly via Compton scattering inside theplastic scintillator, there is no direct information of primary photon energy.However, using the J-PET geometry one can measure the scattering angle of theinteracting photon. Since, $^{22}$Na source emits photons of two differentenergies, it is required to know unambiguously the energy of incident photonsand its corresponding scattering angle for the estimation of energy deposition.In this work, the relationship between Time Over Threshold and energy loss byinteracting photons inside the plastic scintillators used in J-PET scanner isestablished for a energy deposited range 100-1000 keV",S.

The jitter contribution from ETROC is required to be below 40ps to achieve the 50 ps overall time resolution per hit. The analog readoutcircuits in ETROC consist of the preamplifier and the discriminator. Thepreamplifier handles the LGAD charge signal with the most probable value ofaround 15 fC.

The jitterof the analog readout circuits, measured from the discriminator's leading edge,is better than 16 ps for a charge larger than 15 fC with the sensorcapacitance. The time walk resulting from different pulse heights can becorrected using the TOT measurement. The time resolution distribution has astandard deviation of 29 ps after the time-walk correction from the chargeinjection. At room temperature, the preamplifier's power consumption ismeasured to be 0.74 mW and 1.53 mW per pixel in the low- and high-power mode,respectively.

The lack of compilationtechniques for this makes it hard to utilize these instructions: Usingvendor-provided libraries for computationally-intensive kernels is inflexibleand prevents further optimizations, and manually writing hardware intrinsics iserror-prone and difficult for programmers. Some prior works address thisproblem by creating compilers for each instruction. This requires excessiveeffort when it comes to many tensorized instructions.

2311.06530v1,How ChatGPT is Solving Vulnerability Management Problem,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06530v1,"Recently, ChatGPT has attracted great attention from the code analysisdomain. Prior works show that ChatGPT has the capabilities of processingfoundational code analysis tasks, such as abstract syntax tree generation,which indicates the potential of using ChatGPT to comprehend code syntax andstatic behaviors. However, it is unclear whether ChatGPT can complete morecomplicated real-world vulnerability management tasks, such as the predictionof security relevance and patch correctness, which require an all-encompassingunderstanding of various aspects, including code syntax, program semantics, andrelated manual comments.  In this paper, we explore ChatGPT's capabilities on 6 tasks involving thecomplete vulnerability management process with a large-scale dataset containing78,445 samples. For each task, we compare ChatGPT against SOTA approaches,investigate the impact of different prompts, and explore the difficulties. Theresults suggest promising potential in leveraging ChatGPT to assistvulnerability management. One notable example is ChatGPT's proficiency in taskslike generating titles for software bug reports. Furthermore, our findingsreveal the difficulties encountered by ChatGPT and shed light on promisingfuture directions. For instance, directly providing random demonstrationexamples in the prompt cannot consistently guarantee good performance invulnerability management. By contrast, leveraging ChatGPT in a self-heuristicway -- extracting expertise from demonstration examples itself and integratingthe extracted expertise in the prompt is a promising research direction.Besides, ChatGPT may misunderstand and misuse the information in the prompt.Consequently, effectively guiding ChatGPT to focus on helpful informationrather than the irrelevant content is still an open problem.",Peiyu Liu,2023/11/11,2023/11/11

WhileRSs often have a comprehensive view of user preferences across the entire userbase, content providers, by contrast, generally have only a local view of thepreferences of users that have interacted with their content. This limits aprovider's ability to offer new content to best serve the broader population.In this work, we tackle this information asymmetry with content promptingpolicies. A content prompt is a hint or suggestion to a provider to makeavailable novel content for which the RS predicts unmet user demand. Aprompting policy is a sequence of such prompts that is responsive to thedynamics of a provider's beliefs, skills and incentives. We aim to determine ajoint prompting policy that induces a set of providers to make contentavailable that optimizes user social welfare in equilibrium, while respectingthe incentives of the providers themselves. Our contributions include: (i) anabstract model of the RS ecosystem, including content provider behaviors, thatsupports such prompting; (ii) the design and theoretical analysis of sequentialprompting policies for individual providers; (iii) a mixed integer programmingformulation for optimal joint prompting using path planning in content space;and (iv) simple, proof-of-concept experiments illustrating how such policiesimprove ecosystem health and user welfare.",Siddharth Prasad,2023/9/2,2023/9/2

It tunes a prompt for the downstream task, and a verbalizer is usedto bridge the predicted token and label prediction. Due to the limited trainingdata, prompt initialization is crucial for prompt tuning. Recently,MetaPrompting (Hou et al., 2022) uses meta-learning to learn a sharedinitialization for all task-specific prompts. However, a single initializationis insufficient to obtain good prompts for all tasks and samples when the tasksare complex. Moreover, MetaPrompting requires tuning the whole MLM, causing aheavy burden on computation and memory as the MLM is usually large. To addressthese issues, we use a prompt pool to extract more task knowledge and constructinstance-dependent prompts via attention. We further propose a novel softverbalizer (RepVerb) which constructs label embedding from feature embeddingsdirectly. Combining meta-learning the prompt pool and RepVerb, we proposeMetaPrompter for effective structured prompting. MetaPrompter isparameter-efficient as only the pool is required to be tuned.

Unfortunately, obtaininga perfect initialization for soft prompts requires understanding of innerlanguage models working and elaborate design, which is no easy task and has torestart from scratch for each new task. To remedy this, we propose ageneralized soft prompting method called MetaPrompting, which adopts thewell-recognized model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm to automatically findbetter prompt initialization that facilitates fast adaptation to new promptingtasks.Extensive experiments show MetaPrompting tackles soft promptinitialization problem and brings significant improvement on four differentdatasets (over 6 points improvement in accuracy for 1-shot setting), achievingnew state-of-the-art performance.",Yutai Hou,2022/9/23,2023/2/3

While promptinghas emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot and zero-shot learning, it isoften brittle and requires much larger models compared to the standardsupervised setup. We find that co-training makes it possible to improve theoriginal prompt model and at the same time learn a smaller, downstreamtask-specific model. In the case where we only have partial access to a promptmodel (e.g., output probabilities from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020)) we learn acalibration model over the prompt outputs. When we have full access to theprompt model's gradients but full finetuning remains prohibitively expensive(e.g., T0 (Sanh et al., 2021)), we learn a set of soft prompt continuousvectors to iteratively update the prompt model.

The automation of this process can help inreducing the errors in the transformation. In this paper we propose a toolsupported approach for automated transformation of use case specificationsdocumented in English language into analysis class diagrams. The approach worksin four steps. It first takes the textual specification of a use case as input,and then using a natural language parser generates type dependencies and partsof speech tags for each sentence in the specification. Then, it identifies thesentence structure of each sentence using a set of comprehensive sentencestructure rules. Next, it applies a set of transformation rules on the typedependencies and parts of speech tags of the sentences to discover the problemlevel objects and the relationships between them.

Although massive studies have been proposed tofasten the process via proposing advanced elicitation and analysis techniques,it is still a time-consuming and error-prone task that needs to take domainknowledge and business information into consideration. In this paper, wepropose an approach, named ReqGen, which can provide recommendations byautomatically generating natural language requirements specifications based oncertain given keywords. Specifically, ReqGen consists of three critical steps.First, keywords-oriented knowledge is selected from domain ontology and isinjected to the basic Unified pre-trained Language Model (UniLM) for domainfine-tuning. Second, a copy mechanism is integrated to ensure the occurrence ofkeywords in the generated statements. Finally, a requirement syntax constraineddecoding is designed to close the semantic and syntax distance between thecandidate and reference specifications. Experiments on two public datasets fromdifferent groups and domains show that ReqGen outperforms six popular naturallanguage generation approaches with respect to the hard constraint ofkeywords(phrases) inclusion, BLEU, ROUGE and syntax compliance.

A new approach for classification of time series usesclassification trees based on shapelets. A shapelet is a subsequence extractedfrom one of the time series in the dataset. A disadvantage of this approach isthe time required for building the shapelet-based classification tree. Thesearch for the best shapelet requires examining all subsequences of all lengthsfrom all time series in the training set.  A key goal of this work was to find an evaluation order of the shapeletsspace which enables fast convergence to an accurate model. The comparativeanalysis we conducted clearly indicates that a random evaluation order yieldsthe best results. Our empirical analysis of the distribution of high-qualityshapelets within the shapelets space provides insights into why randomizedshapelets sampling is superior to alternative evaluation orders.

Therefore, using machine learning to assistin the revision of patent classification codes (FI) will lead to improvedaccuracy and efficiency.

Most of the modern recommenderand text classification systems require going through a huge amount of data.Manually generating precise and fluent summaries of lengthy articles is a verytiresome and time-consuming task. Hence generating automated summaries for thedata and using it to train machine learning models will make these models spaceand time-efficient. Extractive summarization and abstractive summarization aretwo separate methods of generating summaries. The extractive techniqueidentifies the relevant sentences from the original document and extracts onlythose from the text. Whereas in abstractive summarization techniques, thesummary is generated after interpreting the original text, hence making it morecomplicated. In this paper, we will be presenting a comprehensive comparison ofa few transformer architecture based pre-trained models for text summarization.For analysis and comparison, we have used the BBC news dataset that containstext data that can be used for summarization and human generated summaries forevaluating and comparing the summaries generated by machine learning models.",Anushka Gupta,2021/4/23,2021/4/23

Inthis paper, we propose a new approach based on Q-learning with an edit-basedsummarization. The method combines two key modules to form an Editorial Agentand Language Model converter (EALM). The agent predicts edit actions (e.t.,delete, keep, and replace), and then the LM converter deterministicallygenerates a summary on the basis of the action signals. Q-learning is leveragedto train the agent to produce proper edit actions. Experimental results showthat EALM delivered competitive performance compared with the previousencoder-decoder-based methods, even with truly zero paired data (i.e., novalidation set).

Currently, these voluminous audits must be manually analyzedby officials for oversight, risk management, and prioritization purposes.Automated summarization has the potential to streamline these processes.Analysis focused on the ""Findings"" section of ~20,000 Single Audits spanning2016-2018. Following text preprocessing and GloVe embedding, sentence-levelk-means clustering was performed to partition sentences by topic and toestablish the importance of each sentence. For each audit, key summarysentences were extracted by proximity to cluster centroids. Summaries werejudged by non-expert human evaluation and compared to human-generated summariesusing the ROUGE metric. Though the goal was to fully automate summarization ofA-133 audits, human input was required at various stages due to largevariability in audit writing style, content, and context. Examples of humaninputs include the number of clusters, the choice to keep or discard certainclusters based on their content relevance, and the definition of a topsentence.

Our method is applicable in anydimensionality and to any translation-invariant kernel. The Fast MultipoleMethod, of course, is the leading approach for attaining linear complexity inthe evaluation of long-range (e.g. Coulomb) many-body interactions. Lowcomplexity in translation operators for the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) isusually achieved by algorithms specialized for a potential obeying a specificpartial differential equation (PDE). Absent a PDE or specialized algorithms,Taylor series based FMMs or kernel-independent FMM have been used, atasymptotically higher expense.  When symbolically provided with a constant-coefficient elliptic PDE obeyed bythe potential, our algorithm can automatically synthesize translation operatorsrequiring $\mathrm{O}(p^d)$ operations, where $p$ is the expansion order and$d$ is dimension, compared with $\mathrm{O}(p^{2d})$ operations in a naiveapproach carried out on (Cartesian) Taylor expansions. This is achieved byusing a compression scheme that asymptotically reduces the number of terms inthe Taylor expansion and then operating directly on this ``compressed''representation.

In this paper, we propose to infertranslations as edge-constrained operations that make a supervisedclassification problem invariant using a deep learning framework. As such, ourmethodology uses both the graph structure and labeled signals to infertranslations.

ImagiT first learns togenerate visual representation from the source sentence, and then utilizes bothsource sentence and the ""imagined representation"" to produce a targettranslation. Unlike previous methods, it only needs the source sentence at theinference time.

In the original KIFMM the time-consuming M2Ltranslations are accelerated by FFT. However, when more equivalent points areused to achieve higher accuracy, the efficiency of the FFT approach tends to belower because more auxiliary volume grid points have to be added. In thispaper, all the translations of the KIFMM are accelerated by using the singularvalue decomposition (SVD) based on the low-rank property of the translatingmatrices. The acceleration of M2L is realized by first transforming theassociated translating matrices into more compact form, and then using low-rankapproximations. By using the transform matrices for M2L, the orders of thetranslating matrices in upward and downward passes are also reduced. Theimproved KIFMM is then applied to accelerate BEM. The performance of theproposed algorithms are demonstrated by three examples. Numerical results showthat, compared with the original KIFMM, the present method can reduce about 40%of the iterating time and 25% of the memory requirement.",Yanchuang Cao,2012/11/12,2013/3/12

Unique from existing text-guidedimage generation works, the inpainting models are required to compare thesemantic content of the given text and the remaining part of the image, thenfind out the semantic content that should be filled for missing part. Tofulfill such a task, we propose a novel inpainting model named Text-Guided DualAttention Inpainting Network (TDANet). Firstly, a dual multimodal attentionmechanism is designed to extract the explicit semantic information about thecorrupted regions, which is done by comparing the descriptive text andcomplementary image areas through reciprocal attention. Secondly, an image-textmatching loss is applied to maximize the semantic similarity of the generatedimage and the text. Experiments are conducted on two open datasets.

While such approaches improveperformance, they do not consider the relations between intermediate stepsacross chains and do not provide a unified explanation for the predictedanswer. We introduce Multi-Chain Reasoning (MCR), an approach which promptslarge language models to meta-reason over multiple chains of thought, ratherthan aggregating their answers. MCR examines different reasoning chains, mixesinformation between them and selects the most relevant facts in generating anexplanation and predicting the answer. MCR outperforms strong baselines on 7multi-hop QA datasets. Moreover, our analysis reveals that MCR explanationsexhibit high quality, enabling humans to verify its answers.",Ori Yoran,2023/4/25,2023/10/17

CGCoT effectively shifts pairwisetext comparisons from a reasoning problem to a pattern recognition problem. Wethen pairwise compare concept-specific breakdowns using an LLM. We use theresults of these pairwise comparisons to estimate a scale using theBradley-Terry model. We use this approach to scale affective speech on Twitter.Our measures correlate more strongly with human judgments than alternativeapproaches like Wordfish. Besides a small set of pilot data to develop theCGCoT prompts, our measures require no additional labeled data and producebinary predictions comparable to a RoBERTa-Large model fine-tuned on thousandsof human-labeled tweets.

Objective: We aim to proposean approach Finer Semantic Analysis-based Requirements Conflict Detector(FSARC) to automatically detecting the conflicts between the given naturallanguage functional requirements by analyzing their finer semanticcompositions. Method: We build a harmonized semantic meta-model of functionalrequirements with the form of eight-tuple.

And we defineseven types of conflicts as long as their heuristic detecting rules on theground of their text pattern and semantical dependency. Finally, we design andimplement the algorithm for conflicts detection. Results: The experiment withfour requirement datasets illustrates that the recall of FSARC is nearly 100%and the average precision is 83.88% on conflicts detection.

We find that BCGs are more metal-rich and redder than the ICL, at allredshifts since the ICL starts to form ($z\sim 1$). In good agreement withseveral observed data, our model predicts negative radial metallicity and colorgradients in the BCG+ICL system. By comparing the typical colors of the ICLwith those of satellite galaxies, we find that mass and metals in the ICL comefrom galaxies of different mass, depending on the redshift. Stripping of lowmass galaxies, $9<\log M_* <10$, is the most important contributor in the earlystage of the ICL formation, but the bulk of the mass/metals contents are givenby intermediate/massive galaxies, $10<\log M_* <11$, at lower redshift.

Surprisingly, we do not observe significant degradationwhen using only one randomly chosen demo. To study this phenomenon, for eachtest query, we categorize demos into ""correct demos"" leading to the correctanswer, and ""wrong demos"" resulting in wrong answers. Our analysis reveals aninherent bias in those widely studied datasets: most demos are correct for amajority of test queries, which explains the good performance of using onerandom demo. Moreover, ICL (with and w/o CoT) using only one correct demosignificantly outperforms all-demo ICL adopted by most previous works,indicating the weakness of LLMs in finding correct demo(s) for input queries,which is difficult to evaluate on the biased datasets.

Moreover, a keyfocus is to isolate the relative contributions provided by the main channelsfor the ICL formation to the total amount. The ICL fraction at higher redshiftis weakly dependent on halo mass, and comparable with that at the present time,in agreement with recent observations. Stellar stripping, mergers andpre-processing are the major responsible channels of the ICL formation, withstellar stripping that accounts for $\sim 90\%$ of the total ICL, regardless ofhalo mass and redshift. Pre-processing is an important process for clusters toaccrete already formed ICL. The diffuse component forms very early, $z\sim0.6$, and its formation depends on both concentration and formation time of thehalo, with more concentrated and earlier formed haloes that assemble their ICLearlier than later formed ones. The efficiency of this process is independentof halo mass, but increases with decreasing redshift, which implies thatstellar stripping becomes more important with time as the concentrationincreases. This highlights the link between the ICL and the dynamical state ofa halo: groups/clusters that have a higher fraction of diffuse light are moreconcentrated, relaxed and in an advanced stage of growth.",Emanuele Contini,2023/10/31,2023/11/15

Though ICL has been extensivelystudied on LLMs, its research on VLMs remains limited. The inclusion ofadditional visual information in the demonstrations motivates the followingresearch questions: which of the two modalities in the demonstration is moresignificant? How can we select effective multimodal demonstrations to enhanceICL performance? This study investigates the significance of both visual andlanguage information. Our findings indicate that ICL in VLMs is predominantlydriven by the textual information in the demonstrations whereas the visualinformation in the demonstrations barely affects the ICL performance.Subsequently, we provide an understanding of the findings by analyzing themodel information flow and comparing model inner states given different ICLsettings. Motivated by our analysis, we propose a simple yet effectiveapproach, termed Mixed Modality In-Context Example Selection (MMICES), whichconsiders both visual and language modalities when selecting demonstrations andshows better ICL performance.

To overcome this challenge, we propose NOTEARS-optimizedMixtures of Archetypal DAGs (NOTMAD). NOTMAD models context-specific Bayesiannetworks as the output of a function which learns to mix archetypal networksaccording to sample context.

To predict the future precisely, it is required to capture whichlong-term motion context (e.g., walking or running) the input motion (e.g., legmovement) belongs to. The bottlenecks arising when dealing with the long-termmotion context are: (i) how to predict the long-term motion context naturallymatching input sequences with limited dynamics, (ii) how to predict thelong-term motion context with high-dimensionality (e.g., complex motion). Toaddress the issues, we propose novel motion context-aware video prediction. Tosolve the bottleneck (i), we introduce a long-term motion context memory(LMC-Memory) with memory alignment learning. The proposed memory alignmentlearning enables to store long-term motion contexts into the memory and tomatch them with sequences including limited dynamics. As a result, thelong-term context can be recalled from the limited input sequence. In addition,to resolve the bottleneck (ii), we propose memory query decomposition to storelocal motion context (i.e., low-dimensional dynamics) and recall the suitablelocal context for each local part of the input individually.

Numerical experiments demonstrate that context-aware controllerinference learns stabilizing controllers from orders of magnitude fewer datasamples than traditional data-driven control techniques and variants ofreinforcement learning.

Our systematic experiments indicate that in-context examples shouldbe structurally similar to the test case, diverse from each other, andindividually simple.

We aim to remedy this bytaking advantage of the rich supervisory signal in unlabeled data for learningstate representations. This thesis introduces three different representationlearning algorithms that have access to different subsets of the data sourcesthat traditional RL algorithms use:  (i) GRICA is inspired by independent component analysis (ICA) and trains adeep neural network to output statistically independent features of the input.GrICA does so by minimizing the mutual information between each feature and theother features. Additionally, GrICA only requires an unsorted collection ofenvironment states.  (ii) Latent Representation Prediction (LARP) requires more context: inaddition to requiring a state as an input, it also needs the previous state andan action that connects them. This method learns state representations bypredicting the representation of the environment's next state given a currentstate and action. The predictor is used with a graph search algorithm.  (iii) RewPred learns a state representation by training a deep neural networkto learn a smoothed version of the reward function. The representation is usedfor preprocessing inputs to deep RL, while the reward predictor is used forreward shaping.

Some researches attempted to incorporate expertknowledge and instruction datasets, but the results were costly and led tohallucinations. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised prompt learningmethod to improve Generalization of Image Captioning (GeneIC), which learns adomain-specific prompt vector for the target domain without requiring annotateddata. GeneIC aligns visual and language modalities with a pre-trainedContrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model, thus optimizing thedomain-specific prompt vector from two aspects: attribute and semanticconsistency. Specifically, GeneIC first generates attribute-transferred imageswith differing attributes, while retaining semantic similarity with originalimages. Then, GeneIC uses CLIP to measure the similarity between the images andthe generated sentences. By exploring the variable and invariant features inthe original images and attribute-transferred images, attribute consistencyconstrains the attribute change direction of both images and sentences to learndomain-specific knowledge. The semantic consistency directly measures thesimilarity between the generated sentences and images to ensure the accuracyand comprehensiveness of the generated sentences.

To improve thegeneralization performance on few-shot learning, there have been diverseefforts, such as prompt learning and adapter. However, the current few-shotadaptation methods are not interpretable, and they require a high computationcost for adaptation. In this study, we propose a new method, robust promptlearning with knowledge graph (RPLKG). Based on the knowledge graph, weautomatically design diverse interpretable and meaningful prompt sets. Ourmodel obtains cached embeddings of prompt sets after one forwarding from alarge pre-trained model. After that, model optimizes the prompt selectionprocesses with GumbelSoftmax. In this way, our model is trained usingrelatively little memory and learning time. Also, RPLKG selects the optimalinterpretable prompt automatically, depending on the dataset. In summary, RPLKGis i) interpretable, ii) requires small computation resources, and iii) easy toincorporate prior human knowledge. To validate the RPLKG, we providecomprehensive experimental results on few-shot learning, domain generalizationand new class generalization setting.

But here I refer to the kinds of rules expressed in human languagethat are the basis of laws, regulations, codes of conduct, ethical guidelines,and so on. The ability to follow such rules, and to reason about them, is notnearly as clear-cut as it seems on first analysis. Real-world rules areunavoidably rife with open-textured terms, which imbue rules with a possiblyinfinite set of possible interpretations. Narrowing down this set requires acomplex reasoning process that is not yet within the scope of contemporary AI.This poses a serious problem for autonomous AI: If one cannot reason aboutopen-textured terms, then one cannot reason about (or in accordance with)real-world rules. And if one cannot reason about real-world rules, then onecannot: follow human laws, comply with regulations, act in accordance withwritten agreements, or even obey mission-specific commands that are anythingmore than trivial. But before tackling these problems, we must first answer amore fundamental question: Given an open-textured rule, what is its correctinterpretation? Or more precisely: How should our artificially intelligentsystems determine which interpretation to consider correct?

To this end, we propose a principled frameworkwith provable regret guarantees to orchestrate reasoning and acting, which wecall ""reason for future, act for now"" (\texttt{RAFA}). Specifically, we designa prompt template for reasoning that learns from the memory buffer and plans afuture trajectory over a long horizon (""reason for future""). At each step, theLLM agent takes the initial action of the planned trajectory (""act for now""),stores the collected feedback in the memory buffer, and reinvokes the reasoningroutine to replan the future trajectory from the new state.  The key idea is to cast reasoning in LLMs as learning and planning inBayesian adaptive Markov decision processes (MDPs). Correspondingly, we promptLLMs to form an updated posterior of the unknown environment from the memorybuffer (learning) and generate an optimal trajectory for multiple future stepsthat maximizes a value function (planning). The learning and planningsubroutines are performed in an ""in-context"" manner to emulate the actor-criticupdate for MDPs. Our theoretical analysis proves that the novel combination oflong-term reasoning and short-term acting achieves a $\sqrt{T}$ regret.

To make SAM robust to casual prompts, this paper presents the firstcomprehensive analysis on SAM's segmentation stability across a diversespectrum of prompt qualities, notably imprecise bounding boxes and insufficientpoints. Our key finding reveals that given such low-quality prompts, SAM's maskdecoder tends to activate image features that are biased towards the backgroundor confined to specific object parts. To mitigate this issue, our key ideaconsists of calibrating solely SAM's mask attention by adjusting the samplinglocations and amplitudes of image features, while the original SAM modelarchitecture and weights remain unchanged. Consequently, our deformablesampling plugin (DSP) enables SAM to adaptively shift attention to the promptedtarget regions in a data-driven manner, facilitated by our effective robusttraining strategy (RTS). During inference, dynamic routing plugin (DRP) isproposed that toggles SAM between the deformable and regular grid samplingmodes, conditioned on the input prompt quality. Thus, our solution, termedStable-SAM, offers several advantages: 1) improved SAM's segmentation stabilityacross a wide range of prompt qualities, while 2) retaining SAM's powerfulpromptable segmentation efficiency and generality, with 3) minimal learnableparameters (0.08 M) and fast adaptation (by 1 training epoch).

In this paper, we review and compare three typicalmethods in semi-supervised RE with deep learning or meta-learning:self-ensembling, which forces consistent under perturbations but may confrontinsufficient supervision; self-training, which iteratively generates pseudolabels and retrain itself with the enlarged labeled set; dual learning, whichleverages a primal task and a dual task to give mutual feedback.

To enable the generalization of the GNN, wedevelop a hybrid-task meta-learning (HML) algorithm that trains the initialparameters of the GNN with different communication scenarios duringmeta-training. Next, during meta-testing, a few samples are used to fine-tunethe GNN with unseen communication scenarios. Simulation results demonstratethat our HML approach can improve the initial performance by $8.79\%$, andsampling efficiency by $73\%$, compared with existing benchmarks.

The lowerenergy data are included in the integral of FESR, the more precisely determinedis the non-leading term such as log s, and then helps to determine the leadingterms like log2 s.

Moreover, methods and labels in dialogueevaluation are not fully standardized, especially for open-domain chats, with alack of work to compare and assess the validity of those approaches. The use ofinconsistent evaluation can misinform the performance of a dialogue system,which becomes a major hurdle to enhance it. Thus, a dimensional evaluation ofchat-oriented open-domain dialogue systems that reliably measures severalaspects of dialogue capabilities is desired. This paper presents a novel humanevaluation method to estimate the rates of many dialogue system behaviors. Ourmethod is used to evaluate four state-of-the-art open-domain dialogue systemsand compared with existing approaches. The analysis demonstrates that ourbehavior method is more suitable than alternative Likert-style or comparativeapproaches for dimensional evaluation of these systems.",Sarah E.

Many human beings canreadily transition between these different forms of communication with littleor no effort, which brings about the question: How similar are these differentcommunication modalities? To understand technology$\text{'}$s influence onEnglish communication, four different corpora were analyzed and compared:Writing from Books using the 1-grams database from the Google Books project,Twitter, IRC Chat, and transcribed Talking. Multi-word confusion matricesrevealed that Talking has the most similarity when compared to the other modesof communication, while 1-grams were the least similar form of communicationanalyzed. Based on the analysis of word usage, word usage frequencydistributions, and word class usage, among other things, Talking is also themost similar to Twitter and IRC Chat. This suggests that communicating usingTwitter and IRC Chat evolved from Talking rather than Writing. When wecommunicate online, even though we are writing, we do not Tweet or Chat how wewrite books; we Tweet and Chat how we Speak. Nonfiction and Fiction writingwere clearly differentiable from our analysis with Twitter and Chat being muchmore similar to Fiction than Nonfiction writing.

These manners are cumbersomeand do not allow the tracker to have self-reasoning ability. Therefore, thiswork proposes a new tracking task -- Instruction Tracking, which involvesproviding implicit tracking instructions that require the trackers to performtracking automatically in video frames. To achieve this, we investigate theintegration of knowledge and reasoning capabilities from a LargeVision-Language Model (LVLM) for object tracking. Specifically, we propose atracker called TrackGPT, which is capable of performing complex reasoning-basedtracking. TrackGPT first uses LVLM to understand tracking instructions andcondense the cues of what target to track into referring embeddings. Theperception component then generates the tracking results based on theembeddings. To evaluate the performance of TrackGPT, we construct aninstruction tracking benchmark called InsTrack, which contains over onethousand instruction-video pairs for instruction tuning and evaluation.Experiments show that TrackGPT achieves competitive performance on referringvideo object segmentation benchmarks, such as getting a new state-of the-artperformance of 66.5 $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ on Refer-DAVIS.

However, the limited accuracy and considerable time costs associatedwith existing APR approaches hinder their adoption in industrial practice. Onekey factor is the under-utilization of review comments, which provide valuableinsights into defects and potential fixes. Recent advancements in LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) have enhanced their ability to comprehend natural andprogramming languages, enabling them to generate patches based on reviewcomments. This paper conducts a comprehensive investigation into the effectiveutilization of LLMs for repairing CR defects. In this study, various promptsare designed and compared across mainstream LLMs using two distinct datasetsfrom human reviewers and automated checkers.

In software engineering, they recently attracted attention in codeassistants, with programs automatically written in a given programming languagefrom a programming task description in natural language. They have thepotential to save time and effort when writing code. However, these systems arecurrently poorly understood, preventing them from being used optimally. In thispaper, we investigate the various input parameters of two language models, andconduct a study to understand if variations of these input parameters (e.g.programming task description and the surrounding context, creativity of thelanguage model, number of generated solutions) can have a significant impact onthe quality of the generated programs. We design specific operators for varyinginput parameters and apply them over two code assistants (Copilot and Codex)and two benchmarks representing algorithmic problems (HumanEval and LeetCode).Our results showed that varying the input parameters can significantly improvethe performance of language models. However, there is a tight dependency whenvarying the temperature, the prompt and the number of generated solutions,making potentially hard for developers to properly control the parameters toobtain an optimal result.

An extension to the Lakosian C++design rules is proposed to address multilingual software that uses pybind11.Using a sample of 50 public GitHub repositories that use pybind11, we measurehow many repositories would currently satisfy these rules. We conclude with aproposed generalization of the pybind11-based rules for any multilingualsoftware using an FFI interface.",Damian M. Lyons,2019/6/19,2019/6/19

Softwaredevelopment of CPS has become so difficult that it represents most of the costof CPS production. In addition, it is interesting to note that the integration,verification and validation of software in CPS require more efforts than theanalysis, design, and implementation activities. The main reason is that theseactivities are conducted late in the development process and issues discoveredat this stage of the process will require to rework artifacts produced in theprevious activities (i.e. analysis, design and/or implementation). In thisdocument, we present our work aiming to improve the reliability of softwaredevelopment in the domain of CPS. In this context, we define the reliability ofthe development process as its capacity to deliver intermediate artifacts forwhich the rework effort would be as small as possible. This problem is verydifficult for general purpose software (i.e. used on desktop computers orservers), and even more difficult for software in CPS. The main reason is thatsoftware in CPS is often critical, real-time and embedded on domain specificexecution platforms. As a consequence, non-functional properties (also calledquality attributes) of software applications in CPS are often as important anddifficult to satisfy as the logical correctness of these applications.

Configuration constraints can preemptively avoid misconfiguration bydefining the conditions that configuration options should satisfy.Documentation is the main source of configuration constraints, but it might beincomplete or inconsistent with the source code. In this regard, priorresearches have focused on obtaining configuration constraints from softwaresource code through static analysis. However, the difficulty in pointeranalysis and context comprehension prevents them from collecting accurate andcomprehensive constraints. In this paper, we observed that software logs oftencontain configuration constraints. We conducted an empirical study andsummarized patterns of configuration-related log messages. Guided by the study,we designed and implemented ConfInLog, a static tool to infer configurationconstraints from log messages. ConfInLog first selects configuration-relatedlog messages from source code by using the summarized patterns, then infersconstraints from log messages based on the summarized natural languagepatterns. To evaluate the effectiveness of ConfInLog, we applied our tool onseven popular open-source software systems.

The description usually servesin documentation aimed at programmers, where even brief phrase (e.g.""compresses data to a zip file"") can help readers rapidly comprehend what asubroutine does without resorting to reading the code itself. Techniques basedon neural networks (and encoder-decoder model designs in particular) haveestablished themselves as the state-of-the-art. Yet a problem widely recognizedwith these models is that they assume the information needed to create asummary is present within the code being summarized itself - an assumptionwhich is at odds with program comprehension literature. Thus a current researchfrontier lies in the question of encoding source code context into neuralmodels of summarization. In this paper, we present a project-level encoder toimprove models of code summarization. By project-level, we mean that we createa vectorized representation of selected code files in a software project, anduse that representation to augment the encoder of state-of-the-art neural codesummarization techniques.

As the capabilities of robotic software frameworks increase,the setup difficulty and learning curve for new users also increase. If theentry barriers for configuring and using the software on robots is too high,even the most powerful of frameworks are useless. A growing need exists inrobotic software engineering to aid users in getting started with, andcustomizing, the software framework as necessary for particular roboticapplications. In this paper a case study is presented for the best practicesfound for lowering the barrier of entry in the MoveIt! framework, anopen-source tool for mobile manipulation in ROS, that allows users to 1)quickly get basic motion planning functionality with minimal initial setup, 2)automate its configuration and optimization, and 3) easily customize itscomponents. A graphical interface that assists the user in configuring MoveIt!is the cornerstone of our approach, coupled with the use of an existingstandardized robot model for input, automatically generated robot-specificconfiguration files, and a plugin-based architecture for extensibility. Thesebest practices are summarized into a set of barrier to entry design principlesapplicable to other robotic software.

This algorithm detects conflictsbetween sequence diagrams and inconsistencies in the domain knowledge. Aftersynthesizing statecharts from sequence diagrams, these statecharts usually aresubject to manual modification and refinement. By using the ``backward''direction of our synthesis algorithm, we are able to map modifications made tothe statechart back into the requirements (sequence diagrams) and check forconflicts there.

2012.01815v2,SemMT: A Semantic-based Testing Approach for Machine Translation Systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01815v2,"Machine translation has wide applications in daily life. In mission-criticalapplications such as translating official documents, incorrect translation canhave unpleasant or sometimes catastrophic consequences. This motivates recentresearch on testing methodologies for machine translation systems. Existingmethodologies mostly rely on metamorphic relations designed at the textuallevel (e.g., Levenshtein distance) or syntactic level (e.g., the distancebetween grammar structures) to determine the correctness of translationresults. However, these metamorphic relations do not consider whether theoriginal and translated sentences have the same meaning (i.e., Semanticsimilarity). Therefore, in this paper, we propose SemMT, an automatic testingapproach for machine translation systems based on semantic similarity checking.SemMT applies round-trip translation and measures the semantic similaritybetween the original and translated sentences. Our insight is that thesemantics expressed by the logic and numeric constraint in sentences can becaptured using regular expressions (or deterministic finite automata) whereefficient equivalence/similarity checking algorithms are available. Leveragingthe insight, we propose three semantic similarity metrics and implement them inSemMT. The experiment result reveals SemMT can achieve higher effectivenesscompared with state-of-the-art works, achieving an increase of 21% and 23% onaccuracy and F-Score, respectively.

Software developers also worryabout their applications being reverse engineered by extracting data structuresand algorithms from an application and incorporated into competitor's code. Adefense against software piracy is watermarking, a process that embeds a secretmessage in a cover software. Watermarking is a method that does not aim to stoppiracy copying, but to prove ownership of the software and possibly even thedata structures and algorithms used in the software. The language Java wasdesigned to be compiled into a platform independent bytecode format. Much ofthe information contained in the source code remains in the bytecode, whichmeans that decompilation is easier than with traditional native codes. In thisthesis, we present a technique for watermarking Java programs by using anever-executed dummy method (Monden et.al., 2000) combined with opaquepredicates (Collberg et.al., 1998; Arboit, 2002) and improved with dynamicallyopaque predicates (Palsberg et.al., 2000). This work presents a method toconstruct a dynamic opaque predicates by grouping two or more opaque predicatesaccording to predefined rules. Any software watermarking technique will exhibita trade-off between resilience, data rate, cost, and stealth. To evaluate thequality of a watermarking scheme we must also know how well it stands up todifferent types of attacks. Ideally, we would like our watermarks to survivetranslation (compilation, decompilation, and binary translation), optimization,and obfuscation. Add a single watermark will increasing source code approximate3.854 bytes with dummy method that cover up to 15 characters, two dynamic datastructures, two threads and two opaque predicates.

It provides semantically similar implementations from a large codecorpus to developers based on their queries. Existing techniques leverage deeplearning models to construct embedding representations for code snippets andqueries, respectively. Features such as abstract syntactic trees, control flowgraphs, etc., are commonly employed for representing the semantics of codesnippets. However, the same structure of these features does not necessarilydenote the same semantics of code snippets, and vice versa. In addition, thesetechniques utilize multiple different word mapping functions that map querywords/code tokens to embedding representations. This causes diverged embeddingsof the same word/token in queries and code snippets. We propose a novelcontext-aware code translation technique that translates code snippets intonatural language descriptions (called translations). The code translation isconducted on machine instructions, where the context information is collectedby simulating the execution of instructions. We further design a shared wordmapping function using one single vocabulary for generating embeddings for bothtranslations and queries. We evaluate the effectiveness of our technique,called TranCS, on the CodeSearchNet corpus with 1,000 queries.

Through analyzing the characteristics between biologicalaging and software aging, we find some interesting common points and bridge thegap between these two seemingly unrelated phenomena. The free radical agingtheory in biological studies is also applicative to explore the mechanism andmodel of software aging. This paper finds an equivalent concept named `softwarefree radical' in software aging to free radical in biological aging. In ourstudy, the accumulation of `software free radical' is a root cause of softwareaging. Using the free radical modeling methodology in biological aging, we givea model for describing the kinetic of software aging based on feedback loops.Although this paper doesn't give enough theoretical proof of the modelingmethod, the practical results show that the feedback loop model can describethe kinetic of software aging precisely. To further validate the agingmechanism, we propose several software rejuvenation strategies focusing oncleaning the `software free radical'. The results show that software aging canbe mitigated effectively by strengthening negative feedback loop or weakeningpositive feedback loop.

A major portion of this effort has focused onthe originally proposed view of four ""C""s---components, connectors,configurations, and constraints---that are the building blocks of a system'sarchitecture. Despite being simple and appealing, this view has proven to beincomplete and has required further elaboration. To that end, researchers havemore recently tried to approach architectures from another importantperspective---that of design decisions that yield a system's architecture.These more recent efforts have lacked a precise understanding of several keyquestions, however: (1) What is an architectural design decision (definition)?(2) How can architectural design decisions be found in existing systems(identification)? (3) What system decisions are and are not architectural(classification)? (4) How are architectural design decisions manifested in thecode (reification)? (5) How can important architectural decisions be preservedand/or changed as desired (evolution)? This paper presents a technique targetedat answering these questions by analyzing information that is readily availableabout software systems.

AnAdaptive Chain Visual Reasoning Model (ACVRM) for Answerer is also proposed,where the question-answer pair is used to update the visual representationsequentially. To perform supervised learning for each model, we introduce awell-designed method to build a SQS for each question on VQA 2.0 and VQA-CP v2datasets.

Objective: In this work, we investigate theeffects of imposing a time budget to limit the search for design alternatives,which inevitably affects the quality of the resulting alternatives. Method: Theeffects of time budgets are analyzed by investigating both the quality of thegenerated design alternatives and their structural features when varying thebudget and the genetic algorithm (NSGA-II, PESA2, SPEA2). This is achieved byemploying multi-objective quality indicators and a tree-based representation ofthe search space. Results: The study reveals that the time budget significantlyaffects the quality of Pareto fronts, especially for performance andreliability. NSGA-II is the fastest algorithm, while PESA2 generates thehighest-quality solutions. The imposition of a time budget results instructurally distinct models compared to those obtained without a budget,indicating that the search process is influenced by both the budget andalgorithm selection. Conclusions: In software model optimization, imposing atime budget can be effective in saving optimization time, but designers shouldcarefully consider the trade-off between time and solution quality in thePareto front, along with the structural characteristics of the generatedmodels. By making informed choices about the specific genetic algorithm,designers can achieve different trade-offs.",J. Andres Diaz-Pace,2023/8/29,2023/8/29

The initial decade focused on establishing thetheoretical feasibility of this revolutionary concept and gauging theeffectiveness and limits of this idea. During the next phase, the advent ofsoftware defined radios (SDR) accelerated the growth of this domain due to itsadded flexibility.

In particular, this gives estimates on lengths of characteristic curvesassuming COT is bounded below by a positive constant.  We show that surfaces with constant COT exist and we classify all graphs inthe Heisenberg group with vanishing COT. This is accomplished by showing thatthe equation for graphs with zero COT can be decomposed into two first orderPDEs, one of which is the backward invisicid Burgers' equation.

TheObject Oriented (OO) solution space can be visualized using the language of Settheory with which the design architecture of modules can be well defined. Itprovides a strong base to quantify the relationships within and between themodules, which is a mode for measuring the complexity of solution design of anysoftware projects. This paper provides a visualization of OO modeling from theperspective of Set theory. Thereby, it paves the path for the designers toeffectively design the application which is one of the challenges of a projectdevelopment. Further, this mode of visualization enables one to effectivelymeasure and controls the design complexity leading towards reducing the designflaws and enhanced software quality.",Poornima. U.

At these depths, the limitingsystematic uncertainties are astrophysical: scattered starlight from foregroundGalactic dust, and variations in faint background sources. The dust-scatteredstarlight is well-traced by deep far-infrared imaging, making itdistinguishable from true Virgo diffuse light. Our imaging maps the Virgo corearound M87 and the adjacent M86/M84 region, in subcluster B around M49, and inthe more distant W' cloud around NGC 4365. Most of the detected ICL is found inthe Virgo core and within the W' cloud, with little evidence for extensive ICLin subcluster B. The large amount of diffuse light seen in the infalling W'cloud likely illustrates the importance of the group environment for generatingICL. The bulk of the detected ICL is fairly red (B-V=0.7-0.9), indicative ofold stellar populations. We estimate a total Virgo ICL fraction of 7-15%,somewhat smaller than expected for massive, evolved clusters, suggesting thatVirgo is still growing its ICL component.

The present study is designed to characterise this ICL ina ~10^14 M_odot and z~0.53 cluster of galaxies from imaging and spectroscopicpoints of view. By applying a wavelet-based method to CFHT Megacam and WIRCAMimages, we detect significant quantities of diffuse light. These sources werethen spectroscopically characterised with MUSE. MUSE data were also used tocompute redshifts of 24 cluster galaxies and search for cluster substructures.An atypically large amount of ICL has been detected in this cluster. Part ofthe detected diffuse light has a very weak optical stellar component andapparently consists mainly of gas emission, while other diffuse light sourcesare clearly dominated by old stars. Furthermore, emission lines were detectedin several places of diffuse light. Our spectral analysis shows that thisemission likely originates from low-excitation parameter gas. The stellarcontribution to the ICL is about 2.3x10^9 yrs old even though the ICL is notcurrently forming a large number of stars. On the other hand, the contributionof the gas emission to the ICL in the optical is much greater than the stellarcontribution in some regions, but the gas density is likely too low to formstars. These observations favour ram pressure stripping, turbulent viscousstripping, or supernovae winds as the origin of the large amount ofintracluster light. Since the cluster appears not to be in a major mergingphase, we conclude that ram pressure stripping is the most plausible processthat generates the observed ICL sources.",C. Adami,2016/1/4,2016/1/4

In the era offoundational language models, this study compares and analyzes three NLPparadigms for curation tasks: in-context learning (ICL), fine-tuning (FT), andsupervised learning (ML). Using the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest(ChEBI) database as a model ontology, three curation tasks were devised. ForICL, three prompting strategies were employed with GPT-4, GPT-3.5, BioGPT.PubmedBERT was chosen for the FT paradigm. For ML, six embedding models wereutilized for training Random Forest and Long-Short Term Memory models. Fivesetups were designed to assess ML and FT model performance across differentdata availability scenarios.Datasets for curation tasks included: task 1(620,386), task 2 (611,430), and task 3 (617,381), maintaining a 50:50 positiveversus negative ratio. For ICL models, GPT-4 achieved best accuracy scores of0.916, 0.766 and 0.874 for tasks 1-3 respectively. In a direct comparison, ML(trained on ~260,000 triples) outperformed ICL in accuracy across all tasks.(accuracy differences: +.11, +.22 and +.17). Fine-tuned PubmedBERT performedsimilarly to leading ML models in tasks 1 & 2 (F1 differences: -.014 and+.002), but worse in task 3 (-.048). Simulations revealed performance declinesin both ML and FT models with smaller and higher imbalanced training data.where ICL (particularly GPT-4) excelled in tasks 1 & 3. GPT-4 excelled in tasks1 and 3 with less than 6,000 triples, surpassing ML/FT. ICL underperformedML/FT in task 2.ICL-augmented foundation models can be good assistants forknowledge curation with correct prompting, however, not making ML and FTparadigms obsolete.

We investigate the inductive biases of ICL from theperspective of feature bias: which feature ICL is more likely to use given aset of underspecified demonstrations in which two features are equallypredictive of the labels. First, we characterize the feature biases of GPT-3models by constructing underspecified demonstrations from a range of NLPdatasets and feature combinations. We find that LLMs exhibit clear featurebiases - for example, demonstrating a strong bias to predict labels accordingto sentiment rather than shallow lexical features, like punctuation. Second, weevaluate the effect of different interventions that are designed to impose aninductive bias in favor of a particular feature, such as adding a naturallanguage instruction or using semantically relevant label words. We find that,while many interventions can influence the learner to prefer a particularfeature, it can be difficult to overcome strong prior biases. Overall, ourresults provide a broader picture of the types of features that ICL may be morelikely to exploit and how to impose inductive biases that are better alignedwith the intended task.",Chenglei Si,2023/5/22,2023/5/22

While manystudies discuss these design choices, there have been few systematicinvestigations into categorizing them and mitigating their impact. In thiswork, we define a typology for three types of label biases in ICL for textclassification: vanilla-label bias, context-label bias, and domain-label bias(which we conceptualize and detect for the first time).  Our analysis demonstrates that prior label bias calibration methods fallshort of addressing all three types of biases. Specifically, domain-label biasrestricts LLMs to random-level performance on many tasks regardless of thechoice of in-context examples. To mitigate the effect of these biases, wepropose a simple bias calibration method that estimates a language model'slabel bias using random in-domain words from the task corpus. After controllingfor this estimated bias when making predictions, our novel domain-contextcalibration significantly improves the ICL performance of GPT-J and GPT-3 on awide range of tasks. The gain is substantial on tasks with large domain-labelbias (up to 37% in Macro-F1). Furthermore, our results generalize to modelswith different scales, pretraining methods, and manually-designed taskinstructions, showing the prevalence of label biases in ICL.",Yu Fei,2023/5/28,2023/8/4

We design methods to mask detected galaxies and stars in theimages and stack the cluster light profiles, while accounting for severalsystematic effects (sky subtraction, instrumental point-spread function,cluster selection effects and residual light in the ICL raw detection frombackground and cluster galaxies). The methods allow us to acquire highsignal-to-noise measurements of the ICL and central galaxies (CGs), which weseparate with radial cuts. The ICL appears as faint and diffuse light extendingto at least 1 Mpc from the cluster center, reaching a surface brightness levelof 30 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. The ICL and the cluster CG contribute to $44\%\pm17$\%of the total cluster stellar luminosity within 1 Mpc. The ICL color is overallconsistent with that of the cluster red sequence galaxies, but displays thetrend of becoming bluer with increasing radius. The ICL demonstrates aninteresting self-similarity feature -- for clusters in different richnessranges, their ICL radial profiles are similar after scaling with cluster$R_\mathrm{200m}$, and the ICL brightness appears to be a good tracer of thecluster radial mass distribution.

An under-specifiedor poorly-designed DL model may train successfully but is likely to performpoorly when deployed in production. Design smells in DL programs are poordesign and-or configuration decisions taken during the development of DLcomponents, that are likely to have a negative impact on the performance (i.e.,prediction accuracy) and then quality of DL based software systems. In thispaper, we present a catalogue of 8 design smells for a popular DL architecture,namely deep Feedforward Neural Networks which is widely employed in industrialapplications. The design smells were identified through a review of theexisting literature on DL design and a manual inspection of 659 DL programswith performance issues and design inefficiencies.

In thispaper, inspired by the potential capability of pre-trained language models(PLMs) serving as knowledge bases and few-shot learners, we propose tointroduce prompt-based fine-tuning for stance detection.

Such techniques protectsensed data from external adversaries while assuming that the sensing deviceitself is secure. Meanwhile, both the scale and frequency of IoT-focusedattacks are growing. This prompts a natural question: how to protect senseddata even if all software on the device is compromised? Ideally, in order toachieve this, sensed data must be protected from its genesis, i.e., from thetime when a physical analog quantity is converted into its digital counterpartand becomes accessible to software. We refer to this property as PfB:Privacy-from-Birth.  In this work, we formalize PfB and design Verified Remote SensingAuthorization (VERSA) -- a provably secure and formally verified architectureguaranteeing that only correct execution of expected and explicitly authorizedsoftware can access and manipulate sensing interfaces, specifically, GeneralPurpose Input/Output (GPIO), which is the usual boundary between analog anddigital worlds on IoT devices. This guarantee is obtained with minimal hardwaresupport and holds even if all device software is compromised. VERSA ensuresthat malware can neither gain access to sensed data on the GPIO-mapped memorynor obtain any trace thereof.

For example, ACL can be used for subgoal generation, rewardshaping, environment generation, or initial state generation. However, priorwork only considers curriculum learning following one of the aforementionedpredefined paradigms. It is unclear which of these paradigms are complementary,and how the combination of them can be learned from interactions with theenvironment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a unified automaticcurriculum learning framework to create multi-objective but coherent curriculathat are generated by a set of parametric curriculum modules. Each curriculummodule is instantiated as a neural network and is responsible for generating aparticular curriculum. In order to coordinate those potentially conflictingmodules in unified parameter space, we propose a multi-task hyper-net learningframework that uses a single hyper-net to parameterize all those curriculummodules. In addition to existing hand-designed curricula paradigms, we furtherdesign a flexible memory mechanism to learn an abstract curriculum, which mayotherwise be difficult to design manually. We evaluate our method on a seriesof robotic manipulation tasks and demonstrate its superiority over otherstate-of-the-art ACL methods in terms of sample efficiency and finalperformance.",Jikun Kang,2021/10/6,2022/10/20

First, three curricula of air combat maneuverdecision-making are designed: angle curriculum, distance curriculum and hybridcurriculum. These courses are used to train air combat agents respectively, andcompared with the original method without any curriculum. The training resultsshow that angle curriculum can increase the speed and stability of training,and improve the performance of the agent; distance curriculum can increase thespeed and stability of agent training; hybrid curriculum has a negative impacton training, because it makes the agent get stuck at local optimum.

The frequency is only increased again two milliseconds afterthe last code section containing such instructions has been executed in orderto prevent excessive numbers of frequency changes. Due to this delay,intermittent use of wide vector operations can slow down the rest of the systemsignificantly. For example, previous work has shown the performance of webservers to be reduced by up to 10% if the SSL library uses AVX-512 vectorinstructions. These performance variations are hard to predict during softwaredevelopment as the performance impact of vectorization depends on the specificworkload.  We describe a mechanism to reduce the slowdown caused by wide vectorinstructions without requiring extensive changes to existing software. Ourdesign allows the developer to mark problematic AVX code regions. The schedulerthen restricts execution of this code to a subset of the cores so that onlythese cores' frequency is affected.

We compare our results tosupervised learning approaches that use pretrained language models, such asBERT and its variants. Our results show that prompting with just 32 labeledexamples can achieve a similar level of performance in many key metrics to thatof supervised learning on training sets that are magnitudes larger in size. Incontrast to many other conflict detection approaches, we make no assumptionsabout the type of underlying requirements, allowing us to analyze pairings ofboth functional and non-functional requirements. This allows us to omit thepotentially expensive task of filtering out non-functional requirements fromour dataset.",Robert K. Helmeczi,2022/11/4,2022/11/4

Typical demonstrations generally focus onexisting benchmarks, which may have been used in model training (i.e., dataleakage). To assess the feasibility of using an LLM as a useful assistant botfor programmers, we must assess its realistic capabilities on unseen problemsas well as its capabilities on various tasks. In this paper, we present anempirical study of ChatGPT's potential as a fully automated programmingassistant, focusing on the tasks of code generation, program repair, and codesummariziation. The study investigates ChatGPT's performance on commonprogramming problems and compares it with state-of-the-art approaches on twobenchmarks. Among several findings, our study shows that ChatGPT is effectivein dealing with common programming problems. However, our experiments alsoreveal limitations in terms of its attention span: detailed descriptions willconstrain the focus of ChatGPT and prevent it from leveraging its vastknowledge to solve the actual problem. Surprisingly, we have identified theability of ChatGPT to reason the original intention of the code. We expectfuture work to build on this insight for dealing with the open question of theoracle problem.

Of recent interest is the use of neural languagemodels to build tools, such as Copilot, that assist in writing code. In thispaper we perform a comparative empirical analysis of Copilot-generated codefrom a security perspective. The aim of this study is to determine if Copilotis as bad as human developers. We investigate whether Copilot is just as likelyto introduce the same software vulnerabilities as human developers. Using adataset of C/C++ vulnerabilities, we prompt Copilot to generate suggestions inscenarios that led to the introduction of vulnerabilities by human developers.The suggestions are inspected and categorized in a 2-stage process based onwhether the original vulnerability or fix is reintroduced. We find that Copilotreplicates the original vulnerable code about 33% of the time while replicatingthe fixed code at a 25% rate. However this behaviour is not consistent: Copilotis more likely to introduce some types of vulnerabilities than others and isalso more likely to generate vulnerable code in response to prompts thatcorrespond to older vulnerabilities. Overall, given that in a significantnumber of cases it did not replicate the vulnerabilities previously introducedby human developers, we conclude that Copilot, despite performing differentlyacross various vulnerability types, is not as bad as human developers atintroducing vulnerabilities in code.",Owura Asare,2022/4/10,2024/1/6

The reliability of the software was then estimated andcompared to existing operational data of the sensor device. It is demonstratedthat by using ORCAS, a semantic reasoning framework can be developed to justifyif the software is reliable (or unreliable) while still leveraging the strengthof the existing methods.",Edward Chen,2022/5/24,2022/5/24

While ML-based methods are moreeffective than program analysis-based vulnerability analysis tools, few havebeen integrated into modern IDEs, hindering practical adoption. To bridge thiscritical gap, we propose AIBugHunter, a novel ML-based software vulnerabilityanalysis tool for C/C++ languages that is integrated into Visual Studio Code.AIBugHunter helps software developers to achieve real-time vulnerabilitydetection, explanation, and repairs during programming. In particular,AIBugHunter scans through developers' source code to (1) locatevulnerabilities, (2) identify vulnerability types, (3) estimate vulnerabilityseverity, and (4) suggest vulnerability repairs. In this article, we propose anovel multi-objective optimization (MOO)-based vulnerability classificationapproach and a transformer-based estimation approach to help AIBugHunteraccurately identify vulnerability types and estimate severity. Our empiricalexperiments on a large dataset consisting of 188K+ C/C++ functions confirm thatour proposed approaches are more accurate than other state-of-the-art baselinemethods for vulnerability classification and estimation. Furthermore, weconduct qualitative evaluations including a survey study and a user study toobtain software practitioners' perceptions of our AIBugHunter tool and assessthe impact that AIBugHunter may have on developers' productivity in securityaspects.

Machine translationfrom Arabic most of the time takes standard or modern Arabic as the sourcelanguage and produces quite satisfactory translations thanks to theavailability of the translation memories necessary for training the models. Thecase is different for the translation of Arabic dialects. The productions aremuch less efficient. In our research we try to apply machine translationmethods to a dialect/standard (or modern) Arabic pair to automatically producea standard Arabic text from a dialect input, a process we call ''automaticstandardization''. we opt here for the application of ''statistical models''because ''automatic standardization'' based on rules is more hard with the lackof ''diglossic'' dictionaries on the one hand and the difficulty of creatinglinguistic rules for each dialect on the other. Carrying out this researchcould then lead to combining ''automatic standardization'' software andautomatic translation software so that we take the output of the first softwareand introduce it as input into the second one to obtain at the end a qualitymachine translation. This approach may also have educational applications suchas the development of applications to help understand different Arabic dialectsby transforming dialectal texts into standard Arabic.",Abidrabbo Alnassan,2023/1/9,2023/1/9

Our results indicate that practitionersneed, among other, clarifications about licensing specific software when otherlicenses are used, and for understanding license content. The results of thestudy can be useful for educators and employers, organisations that areauthoring open source software licenses and developers for understanding theissues faced when using licenses, whereas they are relevant to other softwareengineering research areas, such as software reusability.",Maria Papoutsoglou,2021/10/1,2021/10/1

Whilemuch previous research on Stack Overflow has focused on questions and answers(Q&A), recent work has shown that discussions in comments also contain richinformation. On Stack Overflow, discussions through comments and chat rooms canbe tied to questions or answers. In this paper, we conduct an empirical studythat focuses on the nature of question discussions. We observe that: (1)Question discussions occur at all phases of the Q&A process, with mostbeginning before the first answer is received. (2) Both askers and answerersactively participate in question discussions; the likelihood of theirparticipation increases as the number of comments increases. (3) There is astrong correlation between the number of question comments and the questionanswering time (i.e., more discussed questions receive answers more slowly);also, questions with a small number of comments are likely to be answered morequickly than questions with no discussion. Our findings suggest that questiondiscussions contain a rich trove of data that is integral to the Q&A processeson Stack Overflow. We further suggest how future research can leverage theinformation in question discussions, along with the commonly studied Q&Ainformation.",Wenhan Zhu,2021/9/27,2022/7/19

Objective: We aim at profiling software developers by mining their softwaredevelopment process. To do so, we performed a controlled experiment where, inthe realm of a Python programming contest, a group of developers had the samewell-defined set of requirements specifications and a well-defined sprintschedule. Events were collected from the PyCharm IDE, and from the Mooshakautomatic jury where subjects checked-in their code.  Method: We used n-gram language models and text mining to characterizedevelopers' profiles, and process mining algorithms to discover their overallworkflows and extract the correspondent metrics for further evaluation.  Results: Findings show that we can clearly characterize with a coherentrationale most developers, and distinguish the top performers from the oneswith more challenging behaviors. This approach may lead ultimately to thecreation of a catalog of software development process smells.

To address this, few-shot learning has emerged as avaluable technique, allowing LLMs to adapt with minimal task-specific data. Oneinnovative strategy, known as Chain-of-Thought Prompting (CoT), has beenintroduced to guide LLMs in revealing cognitive processes during multi-stepreasoning. In this paper, we propose Code Chain-of-Thought~(CodeCoT), whichconsists of two components: the Vanilla CodeCoT and the Self-exam CodeCoT. Thelatter incorporates self-examination, empowering the model to iterativelygenerate code, formulate test cases, and refine its outputs. Specifically, theprocess entails the generation of test examples by the model corresponding tothe code it is tasked to implement. If it fails on the test examples, then itregenerates the code based on the erroneous code and associated error types.Through comprehensive experiments, we observed that both techniquessignificantly enhance code generation accuracy across various LLM variants.

A common issue with these methods isthe a priori assumption of a number of hypotheses on either the ICL morphology,its surface brightness level or some properties of the brightest cluster galaxy(BCG). The discrepancy on the results is high, and numerical simulations justbound the ICL fraction in present-day galaxy clusters to the range 10-50%. Wedeveloped a new algorithm based on the Chebyshev-Fourier functions (CHEFs) toestimate the ICL fraction without relying on any a priori assumption on thephysical or geometrical characteristics of the ICL. We are able to not onlydisentangle the ICL from the galatic luminosity but mark out the limits of theBCG from the ICL in a natural way. We test our tecnique with the recentlyreleased data of the cluster Abell 2744, observed by the Frontier Fieldsprogram.

To address this we measure the fraction of clusterlight that is held in the Brightest Cluster Galaxy and ICL (BCG+ICL fraction)and the ICL alone (ICL fraction) using observational methods (SurfaceBrightness Threshold-SB, Non-Parametric Measure-NP, Composite Models-CM,Multi-Galaxy Fitting-MGF) and new approaches under development (WaveletDecomposition-WD) applied to mock images of 61 galaxy clusters (14<log10M_200c/M_solar <14.5) from four cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Wecompare the BCG+ICL and ICL fractions from observational measures with thoseusing simulated measures (aperture and kinematic separations). The ICLfractions measured by kinematic separation are significantly larger thanobserved fractions. We find the measurements are related and provide equationsto estimate kinematic ICL fractions from observed fractions. The differentobservational techniques give consistent BCG+ICL and ICL fractions but arebiased to underestimating the BCG+ICL and ICL fractions when compared withaperture simulation measures. Comparing the different methods and algorithms wefind that the MGF algorithm is most consistent with the simulations, and CM andSB methods show the smallest projection effects for the BCG+ICL and ICLfractions respectively. The Ahad (CM), MGF and WD algorithms are best set up toprocess larger samples, however, the WD algorithm in its current form issusceptible to projection effects.

Recent work has shown that precise details of the inputs usedin the ICL prompt significantly impact performance, which has incentivizedinstruction selection algorithms. The effect of instruction-choice however isseverely underexplored, with existing analyses restricted to shallow subsets ofmodels and tasks, limiting the generalizability of their insights. We developInstructEval, an ICL evaluation suite to conduct a thorough assessment of thesetechniques. The suite includes 13 open-sourced LLMs of varying scales from fourmodel families, and covers nine tasks across three categories. Using the suite,we evaluate the relative performance of seven popular instruction selectionmethods over five metrics relevant to ICL. Our experiments reveal that usingcurated manually-written instructions or simple instructions without anytask-specific descriptions often elicits superior ICL performance overall thanthat of automatic instruction-induction methods, pointing to a lack ofgeneralizability among the latter. We release our evaluation suite forbenchmarking instruction selection approaches and enabling more generalizablemethods in this space.",Anirudh Ajith,2023/7/1,2023/7/16

However, theunderstanding of the dynamics of ICL and the aspects that influence downstreamperformance remains limited, especially for natural language generation (NLG)tasks. This work aims to address this gap by investigating the ICL capabilitiesof LLMs and studying the impact of different aspects of the in-contextdemonstrations for the task of machine translation (MT). Our preliminaryinvestigations aim to discern whether in-context learning (ICL) ispredominantly influenced by demonstrations or instructions by applying diverseperturbations to in-context demonstrations while preserving the taskinstruction. We observe varying behavior to perturbed examples across differentmodel families, notably with BLOOM-7B derivatives being severely influenced bynoise, whereas Llama 2 derivatives not only exhibit robustness but also tend toshow enhancements over the clean baseline when subject to perturbeddemonstrations. This suggests that the robustness of ICL may be governed byseveral factors, including the type of noise, perturbation direction (source ortarget), the extent of pretraining of the specific model, and fine-tuning fordownstream tasks if applicable. Further investigation is warranted to develop acomprehensive understanding of these factors in future research.",Pranjal A. Chitale,2024/1/22,2024/1/22

Carefully crafted promptsare used to generate candidate replacements for vulnerable code, which are thenanalyzed for correctness and for leakage resilience. From a cost/performanceperspective, the GPT4-based configuration costs in API calls a mere few centsper vulnerability fixed. Our results show that LLM-based patching is far morecost-effective and thus provides a scalable solution.

For Now,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11868v1,"The recent advances in diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized thegeneration of complex and diverse images. However, these models also introducepotential safety hazards, such as the production of harmful content andinfringement of data copyrights. Although there have been efforts to createsafety-driven unlearning methods to counteract these challenges, doubts remainabout their capabilities. To bridge this uncertainty, we propose an evaluationframework built upon adversarial attacks (also referred to as adversarialprompts), in order to discern the trustworthiness of these safety-drivenunlearned DMs. Specifically, our research explores the (worst-case) robustnessof unlearned DMs in eradicating unwanted concepts, styles, and objects,assessed by the generation of adversarial prompts. We develop a noveladversarial learning approach called UnlearnDiff that leverages the inherentclassification capabilities of DMs to streamline the generation of adversarialprompts, making it as simple for DMs as it is for image classification attacks.This technique streamlines the creation of adversarial prompts, making theprocess as intuitive for generative modeling as it is for image classificationassaults. Through comprehensive benchmarking, we assess the unlearningrobustness of five prevalent unlearned DMs across multiple tasks.

To tackle thislimitation, this study empirically investigates the feasibility of utilizinglarge language models (LLMs) to generate comments that can fulfill developers'diverse intents. Our intuition is based on the facts that (1) the code and itspairwise comment are used during the pre-training process of LLMs to build thesemantic connection between the natural language and programming language, and(2) comments in the real-world projects, which are collected for thepre-training, usually contain different developers' intents. We thus postulatethat the LLMs can already understand the code from different perspectives afterthe pre-training. Indeed, experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstratethe rationale of our insights: by adopting the in-context learning paradigm andgiving adequate prompts to the LLM (e.g., providing it with ten or moreexamples), the LLM can significantly outperform a state-of-the-art supervisedlearning approach on generating comments with multiple intents. Results alsoshow that customized strategies for constructing the prompts andpost-processing strategies for reranking the results can both boost the LLM'sperformances, which shed light on future research directions for using LLMs toachieve comment generation.",Mingyang Geng,2023/4/22,2023/6/14

Specifically, the keystone of traditional RLis to train an agent with large amounts of online exploration making lots of`errors' in the process. In the recommendation setting, though, we cannotafford the price of making `errors' online. As a result, the agent needs to betrained through offline historical implicit feedback, collected under differentrecommendation policies; traditional RL algorithms may lead to sub-optimalpolicies under these offline training settings.  Here we propose a new learning paradigm -- namely Prompt-Based ReinforcementLearning (PRL) -- for the offline training of RL-based recommendation agents.While traditional RL algorithms attempt to map state-action input pairs totheir expected rewards (e.g., Q-values), PRL directly infers actions (i.e.,recommended items) from state-reward inputs. In short, the agents are trainedto predict a recommended item given the prior interactions and an observedreward value -- with simple supervised learning. At deployment time, thishistorical (training) data acts as a knowledge base, while the state-rewardpairs are used as a prompt. The agents are thus used to answer the question:\emph{ Which item should be recommended given the prior interactions \& theprompted reward value}?

In doing this we carefully study various aspects of the nonlinearclustering and then arrive at a useful approximation allowing for a quickcomputation of the nonlinear power spectrum as in the CDM case. The nonlineargalaxy bias is also included in a self-consistent manner within the PTframework.

This paper proposes a simpleyet effective Visual Prompt Unified Transformer (VPUFormer), which introduces aconcise unified prompt representation with deeper interaction to boost thesegmentation performance.

Code-specific LLMs (e.g., GitHub Copilot, CodeLlama2) can generate codecompletions in real-time by drawing on all code available in a developmentenvironment. However, restricting code-specific LLMs to use only in-contextcode is not straightforward, as the model is not explicitly instructed to usethe user-provided code and users cannot highlight precisely which snippets ofcode the model should incorporate into its context. Moreover, current systemslack effective recovery methods, forcing users to iteratively re-prompt themodel with modified prompts until a sufficient solution is reached. Our methoddiffers from traditional LLM-powered code-generation by constrainingcode-generation to an explicit function set and enabling recovery from failedattempts through automatically generated sub-functions.

In this work, we investigate a novelperspective of Code annotation for Code retrieval (hence called `CoaCor'),where a code annotation model is trained to generate a natural languageannotation that can represent the semantic meaning of a given code snippet andcan be leveraged by a code retrieval model to better distinguish relevant codesnippets from others. To this end, we propose an effective framework based onreinforcement learning, which explicitly encourages the code annotation modelto generate annotations that can be used for the retrieval task. Throughextensive experiments, we show that code annotations generated by our frameworkare much more detailed and more useful for code retrieval, and they can furtherimprove the performance of existing code retrieval models significantly.",Ziyu Yao,2019/3/13,2019/3/13

Intuitively, the quality of code changerepresentations is crucial for the effectiveness of automated approaches. Priorwork on code changes usually designs and evaluates code change representationapproaches for a specific task, and little work has investigated code changeencoders that can be used and jointly trained on various tasks. To fill thisgap, this work proposes a novel Code Change Representation learning approachnamed CCRep, which can learn to encode code changes as feature vectors fordiverse downstream tasks. Specifically, CCRep regards a code change as thecombination of its before-change and after-change code, leverages a pre-trainedcode model to obtain high-quality contextual embeddings of code, and uses anovel mechanism named query back to extract and encode the changed codefragments and make them explicitly interact with the whole code change. Toevaluate CCRep and demonstrate its applicability to diverse code-change-relatedtasks, we apply it to three tasks: commit message generation, patch correctnessassessment, and just-in-time defect prediction.

In this work, we run a large-scale study investigating theextent to which DL models tend to clone code from their training set whenrecommending code completions. Such an exploratory study can help in assessingthe magnitude of the potential licensing issues mentioned before: If thesemodels tend to generate new code that is unseen in the training set, thenlicensing issues are unlikely to occur.

In recent years,model-based approaches utilizing abstract syntax trees (ASTs) have been widelyapplied to code classification tasks. We introduce an approach named the SparseAttention-based neural network for Code Classification (SACC) in this paper.The approach involves two main steps: In the first step, source code undergoessyntax parsing and preprocessing. The generated abstract syntax tree is splitinto sequences of subtrees and then encoded using a recursive neural network toobtain a high-dimensional representation. This step simultaneously considersboth the logical structure and lexical level information contained within thecode. In the second step, the encoded sequences of subtrees are fed into aTransformer model that incorporates sparse attention mechanisms for the purposeof classification. This method efficiently reduces the computational cost ofthe self-attention mechanisms, thus improving the training speed whilepreserving effectiveness. Our work introduces a carefully designed sparseattention pattern that is specifically designed to meet the unique needs ofcode classification tasks. This design helps reduce the influence of redundantinformation and enhances the overall performance of the model.

Comprehensiveness ofcode representation is critical to code summarization task. However, mostexisting approaches typically use coarse-grained fusion methods to integratemulti-modal features.

Such a coarseintegration makes it difficult to learn the correlations between fine-grainedcode elements across modalities effectively. Aims: This study intends toimprove the model's prediction performance for high-quality code summarizationby accurately aligning and fully fusing semantic and syntactic structureinformation of source code at node/token levels. Method: This paper proposes aMulti-Modal Fine-grained Feature Fusion approach (MMF3) for neural codesummarization.

To bridgethe gap, we conduct a systematic research to assess and improve the quality offour benchmark datasets widely used for code summarization tasks. First, wepropose an automated code-comment cleaning tool that can accurately detectnoisy data caused by inappropriate data preprocessing operations from existingbenchmark datasets. Then, we apply the tool to further assess the data qualityof the four benchmark datasets, based on the detected noises. Finally, weconduct comparative experiments to investigate the impact of noisy data on theperformance of code summarization models. The results show that these datapreprocessing noises widely exist in all four benchmark datasets, and removingthese noisy data leads to a significant improvement on the performance of codesummarization.

Therehas been a surge of work on automatic code summarization to reduce the burdenof writing summaries manually. However, most contemporary approaches mainlyleverage the information within the boundary of the method being summarized(i.e., local context), and ignore the broader context that could assist withcode summarization. This paper explores two global contexts, namely intra-classand inter-class contexts, and proposes the model CoCoSUM: Contextual CodeSummarization with Multi-Relational Graph Neural Networks. CoCoSUM firstincorporates class names as the intra-class context to generate the classsemantic embeddings. Then, relevant Unified Modeling Language (UML) classdiagrams are extracted as inter-class context and are encoded into the classrelational embeddings using a novel Multi-Relational Graph Neural Network(MRGNN). Class semantic embeddings and class relational embeddings, togetherwith the outputs from code token encoder and AST encoder, are passed to adecoder armed with a two-level attention mechanism to generate high-quality,context-aware code summaries. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate ourapproach and compare it with other automatic code summarization models.

Many existing studies learn the syntactic and semantic knowledgeof code snippets from their token sequences and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).They use the learned code representations as input to code summarizationmodels, which can accordingly generate summaries describing source code.Traditional models traverse ASTs as sequences or split ASTs into paths asinput. However, the former loses the structural properties of ASTs, and thelatter destroys the overall structure of ASTs. Therefore, comprehensivelycapturing the structural features of ASTs in learning code representations forsource code summarization remains a challenging problem to be solved. In thispaper, we propose M2TS, a Multi-scale Multi-modal approach based on Transformerfor source code Summarization. M2TS uses a multi-scale AST feature extractionmethod, which can extract the structures of ASTs more completely and accuratelyat multiple local and global levels. To complement missing semantic informationin ASTs, we also obtain code token features, and further combine them with theextracted AST features using a cross modality fusion method that not only fusesthe syntactic and contextual semantic information of source code, but alsohighlights the key features of each modality.

To this end, we propose the Summarization Program (SP), aninterpretable modular framework consisting of an (ordered) list of binarytrees, each encoding the step-by-step generative process of an abstractivesummary sentence from the source document. A Summarization Program contains oneroot node per summary sentence, and a distinct tree connects each summarysentence (root node) to the document sentences (leaf nodes) from which it isderived, with the connecting nodes containing intermediate generated sentences.Edges represent different modular operations involved in summarization such assentence fusion, compression, and paraphrasing. We first propose an efficientbest-first search method over neural modules, SP-Search that identifies SPs forhuman summaries by directly optimizing for ROUGE scores. Next, using theseprograms as automatic supervision, we propose seq2seq models that generateSummarization Programs, which are then executed to obtain final summaries. Wedemonstrate that SP-Search effectively represents the generative process behindhuman summaries using modules that are typically faithful to their intendedbehavior. We also conduct a simulation study to show that SummarizationPrograms improve the interpretability of summarization models by allowinghumans to better simulate model reasoning.

In compositional question answering, thesystems should assemble several supporting evidence from the document togenerate the final answer, which is more difficult than sentence-level orphrase-level QA. In this paper, we present a large-scale compositional questionanswering dataset containing more than 120k human-labeled questions. The answerin this dataset is composed of discontiguous sentences in the correspondingdocument. To tackle the ComQA problem, we proposed a hierarchical graph neuralnetworks, which represents the document from the low-level word to thehigh-level sentence. We also devise a question selection and node selectiontask for pre-training. Our proposed model achieves a significant improvementover previous machine reading comprehension methods and pre-training methods.Codes and dataset can be found at \url{https://github.com/benywon/ComQA}.",Bingning Wang,2021/1/16,2021/1/16

Binary Classification as an Effective Approach to Multi-Choice Question Answering,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16495v1,"We propose a simple refactoring of multi-choice question answering (MCQA)tasks as a series of binary classifications. The MCQA task is generallyperformed by scoring each (question, answer) pair normalized over all thepairs, and then selecting the answer from the pair that yield the highestscore. For n answer choices, this is equivalent to an n-class classificationsetup where only one class (true answer) is correct. We instead show thatclassifying (question, true answer) as positive instances and (question, falseanswer) as negative instances is significantly more effective across variousmodels and datasets. We show the efficacy of our proposed approach in differenttasks -- abductive reasoning, commonsense question answering, science questionanswering, and sentence completion.

Recently, by converting the images intocaptions, information across multi-modalities is bridged and Large LanguageModels (LLMs) can apply their strong zero-shot generalization capability tounseen questions. To design ideal prompts for solving VQA via LLMs, severalstudies have explored different strategies to select or generatequestion-answer pairs as the exemplar prompts, which guide LLMs to answer thecurrent questions effectively. However, they totally ignore the role ofquestion prompts. The original questions in VQA tasks usually encounterellipses and ambiguity which require intermediate reasoning. To this end, wepresent Reasoning Question Prompts for VQA tasks, which can further activatethe potential of LLMs in zero-shot scenarios. Specifically, for each question,we first generate self-contained questions as reasoning question prompts via anunsupervised question edition module considering sentence fluency, semanticintegrity and syntactic invariance. Each reasoning question prompt clearlyindicates the intent of the original question. This results in a set ofcandidate answers. Then, the candidate answers associated with their confidencescores acting as answer heuristics are fed into LLMs and produce the finalanswer. We evaluate reasoning question prompts on three VQA challenges,experimental results demonstrate that they can significantly improve theresults of LLMs on zero-shot setting and outperform existing state-of-the-artzero-shot methods on three out of four data sets.

In contrast to multiple-choice VideoQA which aims topredict the answer given several options, the goal of open-ended VideoQA is toanswer questions without restricting candidate answers. However, the majorityof previous VideoQA models formulate open-ended VideoQA as a classificationtask to classify the video-question pairs into a fixed answer set, i.e.,closed-vocabulary, which contains only frequent answers (e.g., top-1000answers). This leads the model to be biased toward only frequent answers andfail to generalize on out-of-vocabulary answers. We hence propose a newbenchmark, Open-vocabulary Video Question Answering (OVQA), to measure thegeneralizability of VideoQA models by considering rare and unseen answers. Inaddition, in order to improve the model's generalization power, we introduce anovel GNN-based soft verbalizer that enhances the prediction on rare and unseenanswers by aggregating the information from their similar words. Forevaluation, we introduce new baselines by modifying the existing(closed-vocabulary) open-ended VideoQA models and improve their performances byfurther taking into account rare and unseen answers. Our ablation studies andqualitative analyses demonstrate that our GNN-based soft verbalizer furtherimproves the model performance, especially on rare and unseen answers.

This setting is natural for generaldomain EQA as the majority of the questions in the general domain can beanswered with a single span. Following general domain EQA models, currentbiomedical EQA (BioEQA) models utilize the single-span extraction setting withpost-processing steps. In this article, we investigate the questiondistribution across the general and biomedical domains and discover biomedicalquestions are more likely to require list-type answers (multiple answers) thanfactoid-type answers (single answer). This necessitates the models capable ofproducing multiple answers for a question.

However, automated code generation is still challenging since itrequires a high-level semantic mapping between natural language requirementsand codes. Most existing LLMs-based approaches for code generation rely ondecoder-only causal language models often treate codes merely as plain texttokens, i.e., feeding the requirements as a prompt input, and outputing code asflat sequence of tokens, potentially missing the rich semantic featuresinherent in source code. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the ""SemanticChain-of-Thought"" approach to intruduce semantic information of code, namedSeCoT. Our motivation is that the semantic information of the source code (\egdata flow and control flow) describes more precise program execution behavior,intention and function. By guiding LLM consider and integrate semanticinformation, we can achieve a more granular understanding and representation ofcode, enhancing code generation accuracy. Meanwhile, while traditionaltechniques leveraging such semantic information require complex static ordynamic code analysis to obtain features such as data flow and control flow,SeCoT demonstrates that this process can be fully automated via the intrinsiccapabilities of LLMs (i.e., in-context learning), while being generalizable andapplicable to challenging domains. While SeCoT can be applied with differentLLMs, this paper focuses on the powerful GPT-style models: ChatGPT(close-sourcemodel) and WizardCoder(open-source model).

Concretely, we show thattransformers can implement a broad class of standard machine learningalgorithms in context, such as least squares, ridge regression, Lasso, learninggeneralized linear models, and gradient descent on two-layer neural networks,with near-optimal predictive power on various in-context data distributions.Using an efficient implementation of in-context gradient descent as theunderlying mechanism, our transformer constructions admit mild size bounds, andcan be learned with polynomially many pretraining sequences.  Building on these ``base'' ICL algorithms, intriguingly, we show thattransformers can implement more complex ICL procedures involving\emph{in-context algorithm selection}, akin to what a statistician can do inreal life -- A \emph{single} transformer can adaptively select different baseICL algorithms -- or even perform qualitatively different tasks -- on differentinput sequences, without any explicit prompting of the right algorithm or task.We both establish this in theory by explicit constructions, and also observethis phenomenon experimentally. In theory, we construct two general mechanismsfor algorithm selection with concrete examples: pre-ICL testing, and post-ICLvalidation.

To answer this question,we propose self-contemplation prompting strategy (SEC), a paradigm free fromhuman-crafted demonstrations. The key point of SEC is that, instead of usinghand-crafted examples as demonstrations in ICL, SEC asks LLMs to first createdemonstrations on their own, based on which the final output is generated. SECis a flexible framework and can be adapted to both the vanilla ICL and thechain-of-thought (CoT), but with greater ease: as the manual-generation processof both examples and rationale can be saved. Extensive experiments inarithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, multi-task language understanding,and code generation benchmarks, show that SEC, which does not requirehand-crafted demonstrations, significantly outperforms the zero-shot learningstrategy, and achieves comparable results to ICL with hand-crafteddemonstrations. This demonstrates that, for many tasks, contemporary LLMspossess a sufficient level of competence to exclusively depend on their owncapacity for decision making, removing the need for external training data.Code is available at https://github.com/ruili33/SEC.",Rui Li,2023/9/26,2023/11/26

However, learning to parseto rare domain-specific languages (DSLs) from just a few demonstrations ischallenging, limiting the performance of even the most capable LLMs. In thiswork, we improve the effectiveness of ICL for semantic parsing by (1) usinggeneral-purpose programming languages such as Python instead of DSLs, and (2)augmenting prompts with a structured domain description that includes, e.g.,the available classes and functions. We show that both these changessignificantly improve accuracy across three popular datasets. Combined, theylead to dramatic improvements (e.g. 7.9% to 66.5% on SMCalFlow compositionalsplit), nearly closing the performance gap between easier i.i.d.\ and hardercompositional splits when used with a strong model, and reducing the need for alarge number of demonstrations. We find that the resemblance of the targetparse language to general-purpose code is a more important factor than thelanguage's popularity in pre-training corpora.

Most ICL luminosityincreases come in short, discrete events which are highly correlated with groupaccretion events within the cluster. In evolved clusters we find that ~10-15%of the clusters' luminosity is at ICL surface brightness.

However, recent research has revealed that deep neural networks forskin lesion recognition may overly depend on disease-irrelevant image artifacts(i.e., dark corners, dense hairs), leading to poor generalization in unseenenvironments. To address this issue, we propose a novel domain generalizationmethod called EPVT, which involves embedding prompts into the visiontransformer to collaboratively learn knowledge from diverse domains.Concretely, EPVT leverages a set of domain prompts, each of which plays as adomain expert, to capture domain-specific knowledge; and a shared prompt forgeneral knowledge over the entire dataset. To facilitate knowledge sharing andthe interaction of different prompts, we introduce a domain prompt generatorthat enables low-rank multiplicative updates between domain prompts and theshared prompt. A domain mixup strategy is additionally devised to reduce theco-occurring artifacts in each domain, which allows for more flexible decisionmargins and mitigates the issue of incorrectly assigned domain labels.Experiments on four out-of-distribution datasets and six different biased ISICdatasets demonstrate the superior generalization ability of EPVT in skin lesionrecognition across various environments.

Despite the recent successof large vision language models in many multi-modal tasks, complex situationreasoning over videos involving multiple human-object interaction events stillremains challenging. In contrast, humans can easily tackle it by using a seriesof episode memories as anchors to quickly locate question-related key momentsfor reasoning. To mimic this effective reasoning strategy, we propose theGlance-Focus model. One simple way is to apply an action detection model topredict a set of actions as key memories.

Insteadof that, we train an Encoder-Decoder to generate a set of dynamic eventmemories at the glancing stage. Apart from using supervised bipartite matchingto obtain the event memories, we further design an unsupervised memorygeneration method to get rid of dependence on event annotations. Next, at thefocusing stage, these event memories act as a bridge to establish thecorrelation between the questions with high-level event concepts and low-levellengthy video content.

In doing so, the system maintains and reasons with its ownbeliefs, goals and intentions, and explicitly reasons about those of its user.Belief reasoning is accomplished with a modal Horn-clause meta-interpreter.

However, existingmethods focus on reducing the domain bias of the detection backbone byinferring a discriminative visual encoder, while ignoring the domain bias inthe detection head. Inspired by the high generalization of vision-languagemodels (VLMs), applying a VLM as the robust detection backbone following adomain-aware detection head is a reasonable way to learn the discriminativedetector for each domain, rather than reducing the domain bias in traditionalmethods. To achieve the above issue, we thus propose a novel DAOD frameworknamed Domain-Aware detection head with Prompt tuning (DA-Pro), which appliesthe learnable domain-adaptive prompt to generate the dynamic detection head foreach domain. Formally, the domain-adaptive prompt consists of thedomain-invariant tokens, domain-specific tokens, and the domain-related textualdescription along with the class label. Furthermore, two constraints betweenthe source and target domains are applied to ensure that the domain-adaptiveprompt can capture the domains-shared and domain-specific knowledge. A promptensemble strategy is also proposed to reduce the effect of prompt disturbance.Comprehensive experiments over multiple cross-domain adaptation tasksdemonstrate that using the domain-adaptive prompt can produce an effectivelydomain-related detection head for boosting domain-adaptive object detection.Our code is available at https://github.com/Therock90421/DA-Pro.",Haochen Li,2023/6/9,2023/10/10

Inspired by the recent success ofvisual prompt tuning (VPT), this paper attempts to explore prompt tuning onpre-trained point cloud models, to pursue an elegant balance betweenperformance and parameter efficiency. We find while instance-agnostic staticprompting, e.g. VPT, shows some efficacy in downstream transfer, it isvulnerable to the distribution diversity caused by various types of noises inreal-world point cloud data. To conquer this limitation, we propose a novelInstance-aware Dynamic Prompt Tuning (IDPT) strategy for pre-trained pointcloud models. The essence of IDPT is to develop a dynamic prompt generationmodule to perceive semantic prior features of each point cloud instance andgenerate adaptive prompt tokens to enhance the model's robustness.

They improve upon previous neural network models of code, such ascode2seq or seq2seq, that already demonstrated competitive results whenperforming tasks such as code summarization and identifying codevulnerabilities. However, these previous code models were shown vulnerable toadversarial examples, i.e. small syntactic perturbations that do not change theprogram's semantics, such as the inclusion of ""dead code"" through falseconditions or the addition of inconsequential print statements, designed to""fool"" the models. LLMs can also be vulnerable to the same adversarialperturbations but a detailed study on this concern has been lacking so far. Inthis paper we aim to investigate the effect of adversarial perturbations oncoding tasks with LLMs. In particular, we study the transferability ofadversarial examples, generated through white-box attacks on smaller codemodels, to LLMs. Furthermore, to make the LLMs more robust against suchadversaries without incurring the cost of retraining, we propose prompt-baseddefenses that involve modifying the prompt to include additional informationsuch as examples of adversarially perturbed code and explicit instructions forreversing adversarial perturbations.

In this case, an attack is generated from a knownsurrogate \eg, the ImageNet trained model, and transferred to change thedecision of an unknown (black-box) model trained on an image dataset. However,attacks generated from image models do not capture the dynamic nature of amoving object or a changing scene due to a lack of temporal cues within imagemodels. This leads to reduced transferability of adversarial attacks fromrepresentation-enriched \emph{image} models such as Supervised VisionTransformers (ViTs), Self-supervised ViTs (\eg, DINO), and Vision-languagemodels (\eg, CLIP) to black-box \emph{video} models. In this work, we inducedynamic cues within the image models without sacrificing their originalperformance on images. To this end, we optimize \emph{temporal prompts} throughfrozen image models to capture motion dynamics. Our temporal prompts are theresult of a learnable transformation that allows optimizing for temporalgradients during an adversarial attack to fool the motion dynamics.Specifically, we introduce spatial (image) and temporal (video) cues within thesame source model through task-specific prompts. Attacking such promptsmaximizes the adversarial transferability from image-to-video andimage-to-image models using the attacks designed for image models. Our attackresults indicate that the attacker does not need specialized architectures,\eg, divided space-time attention, 3D convolutions, or multi-view convolutionnetworks for different data modalities.

We discoverthat by progressive stage-wise curriculum learning, the pretrainedrepresentations are significantly enhanced and adaptable to both in-domain andout-of-domain distribution data.  We performed extensive validation on three histology benchmark datasets onboth patch-wise and slide-level classification problems. Our curriculum basedfine-tuning yields a significant improvement over standard fine-tuning, with aminimum improvement in area-under-the-curve (AUC) score of 1.7% and 2.2% onin-domain and out-of-domain distribution data, respectively. Further, weempirically show that our approach is more generic and adaptable to any SSLmethods and does not impose any additional overhead complexity. Besides, wealso outline the role of patch-based versus slide-based curriculum learning inhistopathology to provide practical insights into the success of curriculumbased fine-tuning of SSL methods.

Central to CEC isthe placement of cross-episodic experiences into a Transformer's context, whichforms the basis of a curriculum. By sequentially structuring online learningtrials and mixed-quality demonstrations, CEC constructs curricula thatencapsulate learning progression and proficiency increase across episodes. Suchsynergy combined with the potent pattern recognition capabilities ofTransformer models delivers a powerful cross-episodic attention mechanism. Theeffectiveness of CEC is demonstrated under two representative scenarios: oneinvolving multi-task reinforcement learning with discrete control, such as inDeepMind Lab, where the curriculum captures the learning progression in bothindividual and progressively complex settings; and the other involvingimitation learning with mixed-quality data for continuous control, as seen inRoboMimic, where the curriculum captures the improvement in demonstrators'expertise.

However, harnessing them to learn complexlow-level manipulation tasks, such as dexterous pen spinning, remains an openproblem. We bridge this fundamental gap and present Eureka, a human-levelreward design algorithm powered by LLMs. Eureka exploits the remarkablezero-shot generation, code-writing, and in-context improvement capabilities ofstate-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, to perform evolutionary optimization overreward code. The resulting rewards can then be used to acquire complex skillsvia reinforcement learning. Without any task-specific prompting or pre-definedreward templates, Eureka generates reward functions that outperform experthuman-engineered rewards. In a diverse suite of 29 open-source RL environmentsthat include 10 distinct robot morphologies, Eureka outperforms human expertson 83% of the tasks, leading to an average normalized improvement of 52%. Thegenerality of Eureka also enables a new gradient-free in-context learningapproach to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), readilyincorporating human inputs to improve the quality and the safety of thegenerated rewards without model updating.

This paper presents a new curriculum learning approach forthe efficient training of visual backbones (e.g., vision Transformers). Ourwork is inspired by the inherent learning dynamics of deep networks: weexperimentally show that at an earlier training stage, the model mainly learnsto recognize some 'easier-to-learn' discriminative patterns within eachexample, e.g., the lower-frequency components of images and the originalinformation before data augmentation. Driven by this phenomenon, we propose acurriculum where the model always leverages all the training data at eachepoch, while the curriculum starts with only exposing the 'easier-to-learn'patterns of each example, and introduces gradually more difficult patterns. Toimplement this idea, we 1) introduce a cropping operation in the Fourierspectrum of the inputs, which enables the model to learn from only thelower-frequency components efficiently, 2) demonstrate that exposing thefeatures of original images amounts to adopting weaker data augmentation, and3) integrate 1) and 2) and design a curriculum learning schedule with agreedy-search algorithm. The resulting approach, EfficientTrain, is simple,general, yet surprisingly effective. As an off-the-shelf method, it reduces thewall-time training cost of a wide variety of popular models (e.g., ResNet,ConvNeXt, DeiT, PVT, Swin, and CSWin) by >1.5x on ImageNet-1K/22K withoutsacrificing accuracy.

Typically, this approach involves randomly maskingpatches (tokens) in input images, with the masking strategy remaining unchangedduring training. In this paper, we propose a curriculum learning approach thatupdates the masking strategy to continually increase the complexity of theself-supervised reconstruction task. We conjecture that, by graduallyincreasing the task complexity, the model can learn more sophisticated andtransferable representations. To facilitate this, we introduce a novellearnable masking module that possesses the capability to generate masks ofdifferent complexities, and integrate the proposed module into maskedautoencoders (MAE). Our module is jointly trained with the MAE, while adjustingits behavior during training, transitioning from a partner to the MAE(optimizing the same reconstruction loss) to an adversary (optimizing theopposite loss), while passing through a neutral state. The transition betweenthese behaviors is smooth, being regulated by a factor that is multiplied withthe reconstruction loss of the masking module. The resulting training proceduregenerates an easy-to-hard curriculum. We train our Curriculum-Learned MaskedAutoencoder (CL-MAE) on ImageNet and show that it exhibits superiorrepresentation learning capabilities compared to MAE.

However, there is still significant potentialfor improvement in current text-to-image inpainting models, particularly inbetter aligning the inpainted area with user prompts and performinghigh-resolution inpainting. Therefore, in this paper we introduce HD-Painter, acompletely training-free approach that accurately follows to prompts andcoherently scales to high-resolution image inpainting. To this end, we designthe Prompt-Aware Introverted Attention (PAIntA) layer enhancing self-attentionscores by prompt information and resulting in better text alignmentgenerations. To further improve the prompt coherence we introduce theReweighting Attention Score Guidance (RASG) mechanism seamlessly integrating apost-hoc sampling strategy into general form of DDIM to preventout-of-distribution latent shifts. Moreover, HD-Painter allows extension tolarger scales by introducing a specialized super-resolution techniquecustomized for inpainting, enabling the completion of missing regions in imagesof up to 2K resolution.

We findthat these code-writing LLMs can be re-purposed to write robot policy code,given natural language commands. Specifically, policy code can expressfunctions or feedback loops that process perception outputs (e.g.,from objectdetectors [2], [3]) and parameterize control primitive APIs. When provided asinput several example language commands (formatted as comments) followed bycorresponding policy code (via few-shot prompting), LLMs can take in newcommands and autonomously re-compose API calls to generate new policy coderespectively. By chaining classic logic structures and referencing third-partylibraries (e.g., NumPy, Shapely) to perform arithmetic, LLMs used in this waycan write robot policies that (i) exhibit spatial-geometric reasoning, (ii)generalize to new instructions, and (iii) prescribe precise values (e.g.,velocities) to ambiguous descriptions (""faster"") depending on context (i.e.,behavioral commonsense). This paper presents code as policies: a robot-centricformulation of language model generated programs (LMPs) that can representreactive policies (e.g., impedance controllers), as well as waypoint-basedpolicies (vision-based pick and place, trajectory-based control), demonstratedacross multiple real robot platforms.

On a high level,given an input, a language model can be used to automatically complete thesequence in a statistically-likely way. Based on this, users prompt thesemodels with language instructions or examples, to implement a variety ofdownstream tasks. Advanced prompting methods can even imply interaction betweenthe language model, a user, and external tools such as calculators. However, toobtain state-of-the-art performance or adapt language models for specifictasks, complex task- and model-specific programs have to be implemented, whichmay still require ad-hoc interaction.  Based on this, we present the novel idea of Language Model Programming (LMP).LMP generalizes language model prompting from pure text prompts to an intuitivecombination of text prompting and scripting. Additionally, LMP allowsconstraints to be specified over the language model output. This enables easyadaption to many tasks while abstracting language model internals and providinghigh-level semantics.  To enable LMP, we implement LMQL(short for Language Model Query Language),which leverages the constraints and control flow from an LMP prompt to generatean efficient inference procedure that minimizes the number of expensive callsto the underlying language model.  We show that LMQL can capture a wide range of state-of-the-art promptingmethods in an intuitive way, especially facilitating interactive flows that arechallenging to implement with existing high-level APIs. Our evaluation showsthat we retain or increase the accuracy on several downstream tasks, while alsosignificantly reducing the required amount of computation or cost in the caseof pay-to-use APIs (26-85% cost savings).",Luca Beurer-Kellner,2022/12/12,2023/5/30

Toexplore this viewpoint, a sparse code is used to represent natural images in anoptimal control task solved with neuro-dynamic programming, and itscomputational properties are investigated. The central finding is that whenfeature inputs to a linear network are correlated, an over-complete sparse codeincreases the memory capacity of the network in an efficient manner beyond thatpossible for any complete code with the same-sized input, and also increasesthe speed of learning the network weights. A complete sparse code is found tomaximise the memory capacity of a linear network by decorrelating its featureinputs to transform the design matrix of the least-squares problem to one offull rank. It also conditions the Hessian matrix of the least-squares problem,thereby increasing the rate of convergence to the optimal network weights.Other types of decorrelating codes would also achieve this. However, anover-complete sparse code is found to be approximately decorrelated, extractinga larger number of approximately decorrelated features from the same-sizedinput, allowing it to efficiently increase memory capacity beyond that possiblefor any complete code: a 2.25 times over-complete sparse code is shown to atleast double memory capacity compared with a complete sparse code using thesame input. This is used in sequential learning to store a potentially largenumber of optimal control tasks in the network, while catastrophic forgettingis avoided using a partitioned representation, yielding a cost-to-go functionapproximator that generalizes over the states in each partition.

Moving beyond code completion toAI-supported software engineering will require an AI system that can, amongother things, understand how to avoid code smells, to follow language idioms,and eventually (maybe!) propose rational software designs. In this study, weexplore the current limitations of AI-supported code completion tools likeCopilot and offer a simple taxonomy for understanding the classification ofAI-supported code completion tools in this space. We first perform anexploratory study on Copilot's code suggestions for language idioms and codesmells. Copilot does not follow language idioms and avoid code smells in mostof our test scenarios. We then conduct additional investigation to determinethe current boundaries of AI-supported code completion tools like Copilot byintroducing a taxonomy of software abstraction hierarchies where 'basicprogramming functionality' such as code compilation and syntax checking is atthe least abstract level, software architecture analysis and design are at themost abstract level. We conclude by providing a discussion on challenges forfuture development of AI-supported code completion tools to reach the designlevel of abstraction in our taxonomy.",Rohith Pudari,2023/3/7,2023/3/7
2206.06460v2,MetaTPTrans: A Meta Learning Approach for Multilingual Code Representation Learning,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06460v2,"Representation learning of source code is essential for applying machinelearning to software engineering tasks. Learning code representation from amultilingual source code dataset has been shown to be more effective thanlearning from single-language datasets separately, since more training datafrom multilingual dataset improves the model's ability to extractlanguage-agnostic information from source code. However, existing multilingualtraining overlooks the language-specific information which is crucial formodeling source code across different programming languages, while onlyfocusing on learning a unified model with shared parameters among differentlanguages for language-agnostic information modeling. To address this problem,we propose MetaTPTrans, a meta learning approach for multilingual coderepresentation learning. MetaTPTrans generates different parameters for thefeature extractor according to the specific programming language type of theinput code snippet, enabling the model to learn both language-agnostic andlanguage-specific information with dynamic parameters in the feature extractor.We conduct experiments on the code summarization and code completion tasks toverify the effectiveness of our approach.

QuOTeSintegrates techniques from Query-Focused Extractive Summarization andHigh-Recall Information Retrieval to provide Interactive Query-FocusedSummarization of scientific documents. To measure the performance of oursystem, we carried out a comprehensive user study where participants uploadedpapers related to their research and evaluated the system in terms of itsusability and the quality of the summaries it produces. The results show thatQuOTeS provides a positive user experience and consistently providesquery-focused summaries that are relevant, concise, and complete. We share thecode of our system and the novel Query-Focused Summarization dataset collectedduring our experiments at https://github.com/jarobyte91/quotes.",Juan Ramirez-Orta,2023/6/20,2023/6/20

Previous studies show that deep learning models are sensitive tothe input variations, but few studies have systematically studied therobustness of Transformer under perturbed input code. In this work, weempirically study the effect of semantic-preserving code transformation on theperformance of Transformer. Specifically, 24 and 27 code transformationstrategies are implemented for two popular programming languages, Java andPython, respectively. For facilitating analysis, the strategies are groupedinto five categories: block transformation, insertion/deletion transformation,grammatical statement transformation, grammatical token transformation, andidentifier transformation. Experiments on three popular code intelligencetasks, including code completion, code summarization and code search,demonstrate insertion/deletion transformation and identifier transformationshow the greatest impact on the performance of Transformer. Our results alsosuggest that Transformer based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs) shows morerobust performance than the model based on only code sequence under most codetransformations.

While there are many efforts to extend the context window,we introduce an architecture-independent approach for leveraging the syntactichierarchies of source code for incorporating entire file-level context into afixed-length window. Using concrete syntax trees of each source file we extractsyntactic hierarchies and integrate them into context window by selectivelyremoving from view more specific, less relevant scopes for a given task. Weevaluate this approach on code generation tasks and joint translation ofnatural language and source code in Python programming language, achieving anew state-of-the-art in code completion and summarization for Python in theCodeXGLUE benchmark.

These models leverage masked pre-training and Transformer andhave achieved promising results. However, currently there is still littleprogress regarding interpretability of existing pre-trained code models. It isnot clear why these models work and what feature correlations they can capture.In this paper, we conduct a thorough structural analysis aiming to provide aninterpretation of pre-trained language models for source code (e.g., CodeBERT,and GraphCodeBERT) from three distinctive perspectives: (1) attention analysis,(2) probing on the word embedding, and (3) syntax tree induction. Throughcomprehensive analysis, this paper reveals several insightful findings that mayinspire future studies: (1) Attention aligns strongly with the syntax structureof code. (2) Pre-training language models of code can preserve the syntaxstructure of code in the intermediate representations of each Transformerlayer. (3) The pre-trained models of code have the ability of inducing syntaxtrees of code.

However, they are not suitable for IoT systems,mainly due to their high demands in memory and computing power which are notavailable in many IoT devices. In this paper, we develop a semantic-basedrouting protocol for dynamic IoT systems to facilitate dynamic IoT capabilitydiscovery and composition. Our protocol is a fully decentralized routingprotocol. To reduce the space requirement for routing, each node maintains asummarized routing table. We design an ontology-based summarization algorithmto smartly group similar capabilities in the routing tables and supportadaptive routing table compression. We also design an ontology coding scheme tocode keywords used in the routing tables and query messages. To complete thesummarization scheme, we consider the metrics for choosing the summarizationcandidates in an overflowing routing table. Some of these metrics are novel andare difficult to measure, such as coverage and stability. Our solutionssignificantly reduce the routing table size, ensuring that the routing tablesize can be bounded by the available memory of the IoT devices, whilesupporting efficient IoT capability lookup.

We present GraphCodeBERT, a pre-trained model forprogramming language that considers the inherent structure of code. Instead oftaking syntactic-level structure of code like abstract syntax tree (AST), weuse data flow in the pre-training stage, which is a semantic-level structure ofcode that encodes the relation of ""where-the-value-comes-from"" betweenvariables. Such a semantic-level structure is neat and does not bring anunnecessarily deep hierarchy of AST, the property of which makes the model moreefficient. We develop GraphCodeBERT based on Transformer. In addition to usingthe task of masked language modeling, we introduce two structure-awarepre-training tasks. One is to predict code structure edges, and the other is toalign representations between source code and code structure. We implement themodel in an efficient way with a graph-guided masked attention function toincorporate the code structure. We evaluate our model on four tasks, includingcode search, clone detection, code translation, and code refinement. Resultsshow that code structure and newly introduced pre-training tasks can improveGraphCodeBERT and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the four downstreamtasks.

Thestabilisers of a CSS code have an especially nice structure arising from a pairof orthogonal $\mathbb F_2$-linear subspaces, or in the case of maximal CSScodes, a single subspace and its orthocomplement. On the other hand, phase-freeZX diagrams can always be efficiently reduced to a normal form given by thebasis elements of an $\mathbb F_2$-linear subspace. Here, we will show thatthese two ways of describing a quantum state by an $\mathbb F_2$-linearsubspace $S$ are in fact the same. Namely, the maximal CSS code generated by$S$ fixes the quantum state whose ZX normal form is also given by $S$.  This insight gives us an immediate translation from stabilisers of a maximalCSS code into a ZX diagram describing its associated state. We show that we canextend this translation to stabilisers and logical operators of any (possiblynon-maximal) CSS code by ""bending wires"".

This near-optimality could be theoutcome of extensive early selection during the co-evolution of the code withthe primordial, error-prone translation system, or a result of a unique,accidental event.

2401.03901v1,STAIR: Spatial-Temporal Reasoning with Auditable Intermediate Results for Video Question Answering,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03901v1,"Recently we have witnessed the rapid development of video question answeringmodels. However, most models can only handle simple videos in terms of temporalreasoning, and their performance tends to drop when answeringtemporal-reasoning questions on long and informative videos. To tackle thisproblem we propose STAIR, a Spatial-Temporal Reasoning model with AuditableIntermediate Results for video question answering. STAIR is a neural modulenetwork, which contains a program generator to decompose a given question intoa hierarchical combination of several sub-tasks, and a set of lightweightneural modules to complete each of these sub-tasks. Though neural modulenetworks are already widely studied on image-text tasks, applying them tovideos is a non-trivial task, as reasoning on videos requires differentabilities. In this paper, we define a set of basic video-text sub-tasks forvideo question answering and design a set of lightweight modules to completethem. Different from most prior works, modules of STAIR return intermediateoutputs specific to their intentions instead of always returning attentionmaps, which makes it easier to interpret and collaborate with pre-trainedmodels. We also introduce intermediate supervision to make these intermediateoutputs more accurate. We conduct extensive experiments on several videoquestion answering datasets under various settings to show STAIR's performance,explainability, compatibility with pre-trained models, and applicability whenprogram annotations are not available.

Let $F$ be an alphabet set of size $q$ and $n$ be a positive integer. A$t$-traceability code is a code $\mathscr{C}\subseteq F^n$ which can be used tocatch at least one colluder from a collusion of at most $t$ traitors. It hasbeen shown that $t$-traceability codes do not exist for $q\le t$. When $q>t^2$,$t$-traceability codes with positive code rate can be constructed from errorcorrecting codes with large minimum distance. Therefore, Barg and Kabatianskyasked in 2004 that whether there exist $t$-traceability codes with positivecode rate for $t+1\le q\le t^2$. In 2010, Blackburn, Etzion and Ng gave anaffirmative answer to this question for $q\ge t^2-\lceil t/2\rceil+1$, usingthe probabilistic methods. However, they did not see how their probabilisticmethods can be used to answer this question for the remaining values of $q$.They even suspected that there may be a `Plotkin bound' of traceability codesthat forbids the existence of such codes.

Meanwhile, a couple of recently proposed 3DVQA datasets do not well support 3D VQA task due to their limited scale andannotation methods. In this work, we formally define and address a 3D groundedVQA task by collecting a new 3D VQA dataset, referred to as FE-3DGQA, withdiverse and relatively free-form question-answer pairs, as well as dense andcompletely grounded bounding box annotations. To achieve more explainableanswers, we labelled the objects appeared in the complex QA pairs withdifferent semantic types, including answer-grounded objects (both appeared andnot appeared in the questions), and contextual objects for answer-groundedobjects.

An analysis of existing AQG models shows that they produce questionswhich do not adhere to one or more of {the above-mentioned qualities}. Inparticular, the generated questions look like an incomplete draft of thedesired question with a clear scope for refinement. {To alleviate thisshortcoming}, we propose a method which tries to mimic the human process ofgenerating questions by first creating an initial draft and then refining it.More specifically, we propose Refine Network (RefNet) which contains twodecoders. The second decoder uses a dual attention network which pays attentionto both (i) the original passage and (ii) the question (initial draft)generated by the first decoder. In effect, it refines the question generated bythe first decoder, thereby making it more correct and complete. We evaluateRefNet on three datasets, \textit{viz.}, SQuAD, HOTPOT-QA, and DROP, and showthat it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 7-16\% on all of thesedatasets.

In this paper, we develop a two-fold deep learningmodel: Seq2Seq and a binary classifier that takes in the intent (which is innatural language) and code snippets in Python. We train both the intent and thecode utterances in the Seq2Seq model, where we decided to compare the effect ofthe hidden layer embedding from the encoder for representing the intent andsimilarly, using the decoder's hidden layer embeddings for the code sequence.Then we combine both these embeddings and then train a simple binary neuralnetwork classifier model for predicting if the intent is correctly answered bythe predicted code sequence from the seq2seq model.

Such a code $C$ is called completely transitive if theautomorphism group $\rm{Aut}(C)$ acts transitively on each of the sets $C$,$C_1$, \ldots, $C_\rho$. A code $C$ is called $2$-neighbour-transitive if$\rho\geq 2$ and $\rm{Aut}(C)$ acts transitively on each of $C$, $C_1$ and$C_2$.  Let $C$ be a completely transitive code in a binary ($q=2$) Hamming graphhaving full automorphism group $\rm{Aut}(C)$ and minimum distance $\delta\geq5$. Then it is known that $\rm{Aut}(C)$ induces a $2$-homogeneous action on thecoordinates of the vertices of the Hamming graph. The main result of this paperclassifies those $C$ for which this induced $2$-homogeneous action is not anaffine, linear or symplectic group. We find that there are $13$ such codes, $4$of which are non-linear codes. Though most of the codes are well-known, weobtain several new results. First, a new non-linear completely transitive codeis constructed, as well as a related non-linear code that is$2$-neighbour-transitive but not completely transitive.

One of thepurposes of this work is to present a more general description for theseoptimal five-weight cyclic codes, which gives place to an enlarged class ofoptimal five-weight cyclic codes of dimension 4 over any finite field. As anapplication of this enlarged class, we present the complete weight enumeratorof a subclass of the optimal three-weight cyclic codes over any finite fieldthat were studied by Vega [Finite Fields Appl., 42 (2016) 23-38]. In addition,we study the dual codes in this enlarged class of optimal five-weight cycliccodes, and show that they are cyclic codes of length $q^2-1$, dimension$q^2-5$, and minimum Hamming distance 4.

A subclass of attractive BCH codesis the narrow-sense BCH codes over the Galois field $\mathrm{GF}(q)$ withlength $q+1$, which are closely related to the action of the projective generallinear group of degree two on the projective line. This paper aims to studysome of the codes within this class and specifically narrow-sense antiprimitiveBCH codes (these codes are also linear complementary duals (LCD) codes thathave interesting practical recent applications in cryptography, among otherbenefits). We shall use tools and combine arguments from algebraic codingtheory, combinatorial designs, and group theory (group actions, representationtheory of finite groups, etc.) to investigate narrow-sense antiprimitive BCHCodes and extend results from the recent literature. Notably, the dimension,the minimum distance of some $q$-ary BCH codes with length $q+1$, and theirduals are determined in this paper. The dual codes of the narrow-senseantiprimitive BCH codes derived in this paper include almost MDS codes.Furthermore, the classification of $\mathrm{PGL} (2, p^m)$-invariant codes over$\mathrm{GF} (p^h)$ is completed.  As an application of this result, the $p$-ranks of all incidence structuresinvariant under the projective general linear group $\mathrm{ PGL }(2, p^m)$are determined.  Furthermore, infinite families of narrow-sense BCH codes admitting a$3$-transitive automorphism group are obtained.  Via these BCH codes, a coding-theory approach to constructing the Wittspherical geometry designs is presented.

However, there still exists twochallenges which prevent the algorithm into industry applications. On the onehand, most of the state-of-art algorithms require quadrangle bounding box whichis in-accurate to locate the texts with arbitrary shape. On the other hand, twotext instances which are close to each other may lead to a false detectionwhich covers both instances. Traditionally, the segmentation-based approach canrelieve the first problem but usually fail to solve the second challenge. Toaddress these two challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel ProgressiveScale Expansion Network (PSENet), which can precisely detect text instanceswith arbitrary shapes. More specifically, PSENet generates the different scaleof kernels for each text instance, and gradually expands the minimal scalekernel to the text instance with the complete shape. Due to the fact that thereare large geometrical margins among the minimal scale kernels, our method iseffective to split the close text instances, making it easier to usesegmentation-based methods to detect arbitrary-shaped text instances. Extensiveexperiments on CTW1500, Total-Text, ICDAR 2015 and ICDAR 2017 MLT validate theeffectiveness of PSENet. Notably, on CTW1500, a dataset full of long curvetexts, PSENet achieves a F-measure of 74.3% at 27 FPS, and our best F-measure(82.2%) outperforms state-of-art algorithms by 6.6%.

However,interacting with recent LMMs reveals major limitations that are hardly capturedby the current evaluation benchmarks. Indeed, task performances (e.g., VQAaccuracy) alone do not provide enough clues to understand their realcapabilities, limitations, and to which extent such models are aligned to humanexpectations. To refine our understanding of those flaws, we deviate from thecurrent evaluation paradigm, and (1) evaluate 10 recent open-source LMMs from3B up to 80B parameter scale, on 5 different axes; hallucinations, abstention,compositionality, explainability and instruction following. Our evaluation onthese axes reveals major flaws in LMMs. While the current go-to solution toalign these models is based on training, such as instruction tuning or RLHF, werather (2) explore the training-free in-context learning (ICL) as a solution,and study how it affects these limitations. Based on our ICL study, (3) we pushICL further and propose new multimodal ICL variants such as; Multitask-ICL,Chain-of-Hindsight-ICL, and Self-Correcting-ICL. Our findings are as follows.(1) Despite their success, LMMs have flaws that remain unsolved with scalingalone. (2) The effect of ICL on LMMs flaws is nuanced; despite itseffectiveness for improved explainability, answer abstention, ICL only slightlyimproves instruction following, does not improve compositional abilities, andactually even amplifies hallucinations. (3) The proposed ICL variants arepromising as post-hoc approaches to efficiently tackle some of those flaws.

1610.08503v2,Characterizing Intra-cluster light in the Hubble Frontier Fields,http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08503v2,"We investigate the intra-cluster light (ICL) in the 6 Hubble Frontier Fieldclusters at $0.3<z<0.6$. We employ a new method, which is free from anyfunctional form of the ICL profile, and exploit the unprecedented depth of thisHubble Space Telescope imaging to map the ICL's diffuse light out toclustrocentric radii $R\sim300$kpc ($\mu_{\rm ICL}\sim27$mag arcsec$^{-2}$).From these maps, we construct radial color and stellar mass profiles via SEDfitting and find clear negative color gradients in all systems with increasingdistance from the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG). While this implies older/moremetal rich stellar components in the inner part of the ICL, we find the ICLmostly consists of a $<2$Gyr population, and plausibly originated with $\logM_*/M_\odot<10$ cluster galaxies. Further, we find 10-15% of the ICL's mass atlarge radii ($>150$kpc) lies in a younger/bluer stellar population($\sim1$Gyr), a phenomenon not seen in local samples. We attribute this lightto the higher fraction of starforming/(post-)starburst galaxies in clusters at$z\sim0.5$. Ultimately, we find the ICL's total mass to be $\log M_{\rm *}^{\rmICL}/M_\odot\sim11$-12, constituting 5%-20% of the clusters' total stellarmass, or about a half of the value at $z\sim0$. The above implies distinctformation histories for the ICL and BCGs/other massive cluster galaxies; i.e.the ICL at this epoch is still being constructed rapidly($\sim40M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$), while the BCGs have mostly completed theirevolution. To be consistent with the ICL measurements of local massiveclusters, such as the Virgo, our data suggest mass acquisition mainly fromquiescent cluster galaxies is the principal source of ICL material in thesubsequent $\sim$5 Gyr of cosmic time.",Takahiro Morishita,2016/10/26,2017/8/1

This raises a foundational question: can ICLsolve fundamentally $\textit{new}$ tasks that are very different from thoseseen during pretraining? To probe this question, we examine ICL's performanceon linear regression while varying the diversity of tasks in the pretrainingdataset. We empirically demonstrate a $\textit{task diversity threshold}$ forthe emergence of ICL. Below this threshold, the pretrained transformer cannotsolve unseen regression tasks, instead behaving like a Bayesian estimator withthe $\textit{non-diverse pretraining task distribution}$ as the prior. Beyondthis threshold, the transformer significantly outperforms this estimator; itsbehavior aligns with that of ridge regression, corresponding to a Gaussianprior over $\textit{all tasks}$, including those not seen during pretraining.Thus, when pretrained on data with task diversity greater than the threshold,transformers $\textit{can}$ optimally solve fundamentally new tasks in-context.Importantly, this capability hinges on it deviating from the Bayes optimalestimator with the pretraining distribution as the prior.

However, despite such improvements, thepinnacle of performance remains notably unattained even with thehighest-performing model, indicating that CrossCodeEval is also capable ofassessing model's capability in leveraging extensive context to make bettercode completion.

Toevaluate the method, we chose to automatically complete Ethereum Blockchainsmart contracts (SCs) as the case study due to the strict requirements of SCsecurity. We first fine-tuned the 6-billion-parameter GPT-J model using 186,397Ethereum SCs after removing the duplication from 2,217,692 SCs. The fine-tuningtook more than one week using ten GPUs. The results showed that our fine-tunedmodel could synthesize SCs with an average BLEU (BiLingual EvaluationUnderstudy) score of 0.557. However, many codes in the auto-completed SCs werevulnerable. Using the code before the vulnerable line of 176 SCs containingdifferent types of vulnerabilities to auto-complete the code, we found thatmore than 70% of the auto-completed codes were insecure. Thus, we furtherfine-tuned the model on other 941 vulnerable SCs containing the same types ofvulnerabilities and applied vulnerability-constrained decoding. The fine-tuningtook only one hour with four GPUs. We then auto-completed the 176 SCs again andfound that our approach could identify 62% of the code to be generated asvulnerable and avoid generating 67% of them, indicating the approach couldefficiently and effectively avoid vulnerabilities in the auto-completed code.",André Storhaug,2023/9/18,2023/10/6

Recently, some works aimed tobalance the effects of these two important IDNC metrics but none of themstudied a further optimization of one by controlling the other. In this paper,we study the effect of controlling the decoding delay to reduce the completiontime below its currently best known solution in persistent erasure channels. Wefirst derive the decoding-delay-dependent expressions of the users' and overallcompletion times. Although using such expressions to find the optimal overallcompletion time is NP-hard, we design two novel heuristics that minimizes theprobability of increasing the maximum of these decoding-delay-dependentcompletion time expressions after each transmission through a layered controlof their decoding delays. We, then, extend our study to the limited feedbackscenario. Simulation results show that our new algorithms achieves both a lowermean completion time and mean decoding delay compared to the best knownheuristic for completion time reduction.

The most elaborated contextual sets, which offerblueprints for contextual experiments and computational gates, are theKochen--Specker (KS) sets. In this paper, we show a method of vector generationthat supersedes previous methods. It is implemented by means of algorithms andprograms that generate hypergraphs embodying the Kochen-Specker property andthat are designed to be carried out on supercomputers.

Consequently, this unified method is far more efficient forgenerations of KS sets and their implementation in quantum computation andquantum communication.

Different from prior HIC methods, ourhierarchical prompting is the first to explicitly inject ancestor-classinformation as a tokenized hint that benefits the descendant-classdiscrimination. We think it well imitates human visual recognition, i.e.,humans may use the ancestor class as a prompt to draw focus on the subtledifferences among descendant classes. We model this prompting mechanism into aTransformer with Hierarchical Prompting (TransHP). TransHP consists of threesteps: 1) learning a set of prompt tokens to represent the coarse (ancestor)classes, 2) on-the-fly predicting the coarse class of the input image at anintermediate block, and 3) injecting the prompt token of the predicted coarseclass into the intermediate feature. Though the parameters of TransHP maintainthe same for all input images, the injected coarse-class prompt conditions(modifies) the subsequent feature extraction and encourages a dynamic focus onrelatively subtle differences among the descendant classes. Extensiveexperiments show that TransHP improves image classification on accuracy (e.g.,improving ViT-B/16 by +2.83% ImageNet classification accuracy), training dataefficiency (e.g., +12.69% improvement under 10% ImageNet training data), andmodel explainability.

The attack prompt is composed of three important components: (1)original input (OI) including the original sample and its ground-truth label,(2) attack objective (AO) illustrating a task description of generating a newsample that can fool itself without changing the semantic meaning, and (3)attack guidance (AG) containing the perturbation instructions to guide the LLMon how to complete the task by perturbing the original sample at character,word, and sentence levels, respectively. Besides, we use a fidelity filter toensure that PromptAttack maintains the original semantic meanings of theadversarial examples. Further, we enhance the attack power of PromptAttack byensembling adversarial examples at different perturbation levels.

2310.15991v1,White-box Compiler Fuzzing Empowered by Large Language Models,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15991v1,"Compiler correctness is crucial, as miscompilation falsifying the programbehaviors can lead to serious consequences. In the literature, fuzzing has beenextensively studied to uncover compiler defects. However, compiler fuzzingremains challenging: Existing arts focus on black- and grey-box fuzzing, whichgenerates tests without sufficient understanding of internal compilerbehaviors. As such, they often fail to construct programs to exerciseconditions of intricate optimizations. Meanwhile, traditional white-boxtechniques are computationally inapplicable to the giant codebase of compilers.Recent advances demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in codegeneration/understanding tasks and have achieved state-of-the-art performancein black-box fuzzing. Nonetheless, prompting LLMs with compiler source-codeinformation remains a missing piece of research in compiler testing.  To this end, we propose WhiteFox, the first white-box compiler fuzzer usingLLMs with source-code information to test compiler optimization. WhiteFoxadopts a dual-model framework: (i) an analysis LLM examines the low-leveloptimization source code and produces requirements on the high-level testprograms that can trigger the optimization; (ii) a generation LLM produces testprograms based on the summarized requirements. Additionally,optimization-triggering tests are used as feedback to further enhance the testgeneration on the fly. Our evaluation on four popular compilers shows thatWhiteFox can generate high-quality tests to exercise deep optimizationsrequiring intricate conditions, practicing up to 80 more optimizations thanstate-of-the-art fuzzers. To date, WhiteFox has found in total 96 bugs, with 80confirmed as previously unknown and 51 already fixed. Beyond compiler testing,WhiteFox can also be adapted for white-box fuzzing of other complex, real-worldsoftware systems in general.",Chenyuan Yang,2023/10/24,2023/10/24

To this end, in this paper, we make the following 4 contributions: (1)To alleviate base class overfitting, we propose a novel Language-Aware SoftPrompting (LASP) learning method by means of a text-to-text cross-entropy lossthat maximizes the probability of the learned prompts to be correctlyclassified with respect to pre-defined hand-crafted textual prompts. (2) Toincrease the representation capacity of the prompts, we propose grouped LASPwhere each group of prompts is optimized with respect to a separate subset oftextual prompts. (3) We identify a visual-language misalignment introduced byprompt learning and LASP, and more importantly, propose a re-calibrationmechanism to address it. (4) We show that LASP is inherently amenable toincluding, during training, virtual classes, i.e. class names for which novisual samples are available, further increasing the robustness of the learnedprompts. Through evaluations on 11 datasets, we show that our approach (a)significantly outperforms all prior works on soft prompting, and (b) matchesand surpasses, for the first time, the accuracy on novel classes obtained byhand-crafted prompts and CLIP for 8 out of 11 test datasets.

Previousresults on simulation-based testing for SDCs have shown that many automaticallygenerated tests do not strongly contribute to identification of SDC faults,hence do not contribute towards increasing the quality of SDCs. Because runningsuch ""uninformative"" tests generally leads to a waste of computationalresources and a drastic increase in the testing cost of SDCs, testers shouldavoid them. However, identifying ""uninformative"" tests before running themremains an open challenge. Hence, this paper proposes SDCScissor, a frameworkthat leverages Machine Learning (ML) to identify SDC tests that are unlikely todetect faults in the SDC software under test, thus enabling testers to skiptheir execution and drastically increase the cost-effectiveness ofsimulation-based testing of SDCs software. Our evaluation concerning the usageof six ML models on two large datasets characterized by 22'652 tests showedthat SDC-Scissor achieved a classification F1-score up to 96%.

An example of an area facingthe oracle problem is automatic image classification, using machine learning toclassify an input image as one of a set of predefined classes. An approach tosoftware testing that alleviates the oracle problem is metamorphic testing(MT). While traditional software testing examines the correctness of individualtest cases, MT instead examines the relations amongst multiple executions oftest cases and their outputs. These relations are called metamorphic relations(MRs): if an MR is found to be violated, then a fault must exist in the SUT.This paper examines the problem of classifying images containing visuallyhidden markers called Artcodes, and applies MT to verify and enhance thetrained classifiers. This paper further examines two MRs, Separation andOcclusion, and reports on their capability in verifying the imageclassification using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in conjunction withthree other statistical analysis methods: t-test (for unequal variances),Kruskal-Wallis test, and Dunnett's test. In addition to our previously-studiedclassifier, that used Random Forests, we introduce a new classifier that uses asupport vector machine, and present its MR-augmented version.

Pastresults on software testing optimization have shown that not all the testscontribute equally to establishing confidence in test subjects' quality andreliability, with some \uninformative"" tests that can be skipped (or removed)to reduce testing effort. However, this problem was partially addressed in thecontext of SDC simulation platforms.

We propose an approach called SDC-Scissor (SDCcoSt-effeCtIve teSt SelectOR), which leverages machine learning (ML) strategiesto identify and skip tests that are unlikely to detect faults in SDCs beforeexecuting them. Specifically, SDC-Scissor extract features concerning thecharacteristics of the test scenarios being executed in the simulationenvironment and via ML strategies predict tests that lead to faults beforeexecuting them. Our evaluation shows that SDC-Scissor achieved highclassification accuracy (up to 93.4%) in classifying tests leading to a faultwhich allows improving testing cost-effectiveness: SDC-Scissor was able toreduce (ca. 170%) the time spent in running irrelevant tests as well asidentified 33% more failure triggering tests compared to a randomized baseline.Interestingly, SDC-Scissor does not introduce significant computationaloverhead in the SDCs testing process, which is critical to SDC development inindustrial settings.",Sajad Khatiri,2021/11/8,2021/11/8

TransRepair combinesmutation with metamorphic testing to detect inconsistency bugs (without accessto human oracles). It then adopts probability-reference or cross-reference topost-process the translations, in a grey-box or black-box manner, to repair theinconsistencies. Our evaluation on two state-of-the-art translators, GoogleTranslate and Transformer, indicates that TransRepair has a high precision(99%) on generating input pairs with consistent translations. With these tests,using automatic consistency metrics and manual assessment, we find that GoogleTranslate and Transformer have approximately 36% and 40% inconsistency bugs.Black-box repair fixes 28% and 19% bugs on average for Google Translate andTransformer. Grey-box repair fixes 30% bugs on average for Transformer. Manualinspection indicates that the translations repaired by our approach improveconsistency in 87% of cases (degrading it in 2%), and that our repairs havebetter translation acceptability in 27% of the cases (worse in 8%).",Zeyu Sun,2019/10/7,2019/12/25

However, themajority of unsupervised machine translation approaches rely onback-translation, a method developed in the context of natural languagetranslation and one that inherently involves training on noisy inputs.Unfortunately, source code is highly sensitive to small changes; a single tokencan result in compilation failures or erroneous programs, unlike naturallanguages where small inaccuracies may not change the meaning of a sentence. Toaddress this issue, we propose to leverage an automated unit-testing system tofilter out invalid translations, thereby creating a fully tested parallelcorpus. We found that fine-tuning an unsupervised model with this filtered dataset significantly reduces the noise in the translations so-generated,comfortably outperforming the state-of-the-art for all language pairs studied.In particular, for Java $\to$ Python and Python $\to$ C++ we outperform thebest previous methods by more than 16% and 24% respectively, reducing the errorrate by more than 35%.",Baptiste Roziere,2021/10/13,2022/2/16

Forthese reasons, a long standing goal within the research community is to(partially) automate software testing. While several techniques and tools havebeen proposed to automatically generate test methods, recent work hascriticized the quality and usefulness of the assert statements they generate.Therefore, we employ a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) based approach calledAtlas(AuTomatic Learning of Assert Statements) to automatically generatemeaningful assert statements for test methods. Given a test method and a focalmethod (i.e.,the main method under test), Atlas can predict a meaningful assertstatement to assess the correctness of the focal method. We applied Atlas tothousands of test methods from GitHub projects and it was able to predict theexact assert statement manually written by developers in 31% of the cases whenonly considering the top-1 predicted assert. When considering the top-5predicted assert statements, Atlas is able to predict exact matches in 50% ofthe cases.

In testing, atest oracle is used to determine whether a test is passed or failed duringtesting, and unfortunately, for much of bioinformatics software, the exactexpected outcomes are not well defined. Thus, the main challenge associatedwith conducting systematic testing on bioinformatics software is the oracleproblem.  Metamorphic testing (MT) is a technique used to test programs that face theoracle problem. MT uses metamorphic relations (MRs) to determine whether a testhas passed or failed and specifies how the output should change according to aspecific change made to the input. In this work, we use MT to test LingPipe, atool for processing text using computational linguistics, often used inbioinformatics for bio-entity recognition from biomedical literature.  First, we identify a set of MRs for testing any bio-entity recognitionprogram. Then we develop a set of test cases that can be used to testLingPipe's bio-entity recognition functionality using these MRs. To evaluatethe effectiveness of this testing process, we automatically generate a set offaulty versions of LingPipe.

Specifically, weadopt Levy flight for population initialization to increase the diversity ofgenerated test cases. We also design an inertial weight adaptive updateoperator to improve the efficiency of LEAP's global optimization ofhigh-dimensional text examples and a mutation operator based on the greedystrategy to reduce the search time. We conducted a series of experiments tovalidate LEAP's ability to test NLP software and found that the average successrate of LEAP in generating adversarial test cases is 79.1%, which is 6.1%higher than the next best approach (PSOattack).

However, softwaretester role is stigmatized, partly due to misperception and partly due to thetreatment of the testing process within the software industry. The presentstudy analyses this situation aiming to explore what might inhibit anindividual from taking up a software testing career. In order to investigatethis issue, we surveyed 132 senior students pursuing degrees in informationsystems, information and communication technology, computer science, computerengineering, software engineering, and other closely-related disciplines atthree universities in the United Arab Emirates: two publicly funded and onetop-notch private university. The students were asked to describe the PROs andCONs of taking up a career in software testing and to ponder the likelihoodthat they would take up the career themselves. The study identified 7 main PROsand 9 main CONSs for pursuing a testing career, and indicated that the role ofsoftware tester is perceived as a social role, which may require as many softskills as technical prowess. The results also show that UAE software-relatedstudents have a stronger negative attitude towards software testing compared totheir counterparts in other countries where similar investigations have beencarried out in the past three years.",Luiz Fernando Capretz,2022/9/29,2022/9/29

Text input, asan important interaction channel between users and applications, plays animportant role in core functionality such as search queries, authentication,messaging, etc. However, certain special text (e.g., -18 for Font Size) cancause the app to crash, and generating diversified unusual inputs for fullytesting the app is highly demanded. Nevertheless, this is also challenging dueto the combination of explosion dilemma, high context sensitivity, and complexconstraint relations. This paper proposes InputBlaster which leverages the LLMto automatically generate unusual text inputs for mobile app crash detection.It formulates the unusual inputs generation problem as a task of producing aset of test generators, each of which can yield a batch of unusual text inputsunder the same mutation rule. In detail, InputBlaster leverages LLM to producethe test generators together with the mutation rules serving as the reasoningchain, and utilizes the in-context learning schema to demonstrate the LLM withexamples for boosting the performance. InputBlaster is evaluated on 36 textinput widgets with cash bugs involving 31 popular Android apps, and resultsshow that it achieves 78% bug detection rate, with 136% higher than the bestbaseline.

Criticshave responded that these findings are based on too few and too easily solvedtasks to draw meaningful conclusions. To resolve this dispute, we test whetherlogically invalid CoT prompts offer the same level of performance gains aslogically valid prompts on the hardest tasks in the BIG-Bench benchmark, termedBIG-Bench Hard (BBH).

To balance thesecurity, performance, and costs, a DApp typically consists of two layers: anon-chain layer to execute transactions and store crucial data on the blockchainand an off-chain layer to interact with users. A DApp needs to synchronize itsoff-chain layer with the on-chain layer proactively. Otherwise, theinconsistent data in the off-chain layer could mislead users and causeundesirable consequences, e.g., loss of transaction fees. However, transactionssent to the blockchain are not guaranteed to be executed and could even bereversed after execution due to chain reorganization. Such non-determinism inthe transaction execution is unique to blockchain. DApp developers may fail toperform the on-chain-off-chain synchronization accurately due to their lack offamiliarity with the complex transaction lifecycle. In this work, weinvestigate the challenges of synchronizing on-chain and off-chain data inEthereum-based DApps. We present two types of bugs that could result ininconsistencies between the on-chain and off-chain layers. To help detect suchon-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs, we introduce a state transition modelto guide the testing of DApps and propose two effective oracles to facilitatethe automatic identification of bugs. We build the first testing framework,DArcher, to detect on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs in DApps. We haveevaluated DArcher on 11 popular real-world DApps. DArcher achieves highprecision (99.3%), recall (87.6%), and accuracy (89.4%) in bug detection andsignificantly outperforms the baseline methods. It has found 15 real bugs inthe 11 DApps.

However, thereare few studies regarding the impact of the demonstration number on the ICLperformance within a limited input length of LLM, because it is commonlybelieved that the number of demonstrations is positively correlated with modelperformance. In this paper, we found this conclusion does not always hold true.Through pilot experiments, we discover that increasing the number ofdemonstrations does not necessarily lead to improved performance. Building uponthis insight, we propose a Dynamic Demonstrations Controller (D$^2$Controller),which can improve the ICL performance by adjusting the number of demonstrationsdynamically.

We find the transition radius to beindependent of both BCG+ICL and halo masses, with an average of 60$\pm$40 kpc,in good agreement with previous observational measurements, but given the largescatter, it can be considered as a sort of physical separation between the twocomponents only on cluster scale. From the analysis of $M_{ICL}-M_{BCG+ICL}$relation, we build a method able to extract the ICL mass directly from theknowledge of the BCG+ICL one. Given the large scatter on low mass systems, suchmethod under/overpredicts the true value of the ICL in a significant way, up toa factor of three in the worst cases. On the other hand, for $\logM_{BCG+ICL}>12$ or $\log M_{Halo}>14$, the difference between the true valueand the one extracted from the $M_{ICL}-M_{BCG+ICL}$ relation ranges between$\pm$30\%. We therefore suggest this relation as a reliable test forobservational works aiming to isolate the ICL from the BCG, for systems hostedby haloes on cluster scale.",E. Contini,2022/2/22,2022/3/10

Although the prevailing CL model hasachieved great progress, in this paper, we uncover an ever-overlookedphenomenon: When the CL model is trained with full images, the performancetested in full images is better than that in foreground areas; when the CLmodel is trained with foreground areas, the performance tested in full imagesis worse than that in foreground areas. This observation reveals thatbackgrounds in images may interfere with the model learning semanticinformation and their influence has not been fully eliminated. To tackle thisissue, we build a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to model the background as aconfounder. We propose a backdoor adjustment-based regularization method,namely Interventional Contrastive Learning with Meta Semantic Regularizer(ICL-MSR), to perform causal intervention towards the proposed SCM. ICL-MSR canbe incorporated into any existing CL methods to alleviate backgrounddistractions from representation learning. Theoretically, we prove that ICL-MSRachieves a tighter error bound. Empirically, our experiments on multiplebenchmark datasets demonstrate that ICL-MSR is able to improve the performancesof different state-of-the-art CL methods.",Wenwen Qiang,2022/6/29,2022/6/29
2305.05940v3,Multilingual LLMs are Better Cross-lingual In-context Learners with Alignment,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05940v3,"In-context learning (ICL) unfolds as large language models become capable ofinferring test labels conditioned on a few labeled samples without any gradientupdate. ICL-enabled large language models provide a promising step forwardtoward bypassing recurrent annotation costs in a low-resource setting. Yet,only a handful of past studies have explored ICL in a cross-lingual setting, inwhich the need for transferring label-knowledge from a high-resource languageto a low-resource one is immensely crucial. To bridge the gap, we provide thefirst in-depth analysis of ICL for cross-lingual text classification. We findthat the prevalent mode of selecting random input-label pairs to construct theprompt-context is severely limited in the case of cross-lingual ICL, primarilydue to the lack of alignment in the input as well as the output spaces. Tomitigate this, we propose a novel prompt construction strategy -- Cross-lingualIn-context Source-Target Alignment (X-InSTA). With an injected coherence in thesemantics of the input examples and a task-based alignment across the sourceand target languages, X-InSTA is able to outperform random prompt selection bya large margin across three different tasks using 44 different cross-lingualpairs.",Eshaan Tanwar,2023/5/10,2023/6/24
2305.12766v2,Explaining Emergent In-Context Learning as Kernel Regression,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12766v2,"Large language models (LLMs) have initiated a paradigm shift in transferlearning. In contrast to the classic pretraining-then-finetuning procedure, inorder to use LLMs for downstream prediction tasks, one only needs to provide afew demonstrations, known as in-context examples, without adding more orupdating existing model parameters. This in-context learning (ICL) capabilityof LLMs is intriguing, and it is not yet fully understood how pretrained LLMsacquire such capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the reason why atransformer-based language model can accomplish in-context learning afterpre-training on a general language corpus by proposing one hypothesis that LLMscan simulate kernel regression with internal representations when faced within-context examples. More concretely, we first prove that Bayesian inference onin-context prompts can be asymptotically understood as kernel regression $\haty = \sum_i y_i K(x, x_i)/\sum_i K(x, x_i)$ as the number of in-contextdemonstrations grows. Then, we empirically investigate the in-context behaviorsof language models. We find that during ICL, the attention and hidden featuresin LLMs match the behaviors of a kernel regression. Finally, our theoryprovides insights into multiple phenomena observed in the ICL field: whyretrieving demonstrative samples similar to test samples can help, why ICLperformance is sensitive to the output formats, and why ICL accuracy benefitsfrom selecting in-distribution and representative samples.",Chi Han,2023/5/22,2023/10/5

Despite this, thoroughlytesting SDCs in simulated environments remains challenging because SDCs must betested in a sheer amount of long-running test cases. Past results on softwaretesting optimization have shown that not all the test cases contribute equallyto establishing confidence in test subjects' quality and reliability, and theexecution of ""safe and uninformative"" test cases can be skipped to reducetesting effort. However, this problem is only partially addressed in thecontext of SDC simulation platforms.

Given the legal consequencesof incorrectly filing taxes for the taxpayer, ensuring the correctness of taxsoftware is of paramount importance. Metamorphic testing has emerged as aleading solution to test and debug legal-critical tax software due to theabsence of correctness requirements and trustworthy datasets.

In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of the state of flakytests in JavaScript. We investigate two aspects of flaky tests in JavaScriptprojects: the main causes of flaky tests in these projects and common fixingstrategies. By analysing 452 commits from large, top-scoring JavaScriptprojects from GitHub, we found that flakiness caused by concurrency-relatedissues (e.g., async wait, race conditions or deadlocks) is the most dominantreason for test flakiness. The other top causes of flaky tests are operatingsystem-specific (e.g., features that work on specific OS or OS versions) andnetwork stability (e.g., internet availability or bad socket management).

At industrial systems the scale and size ofFacebook's, doing this is infeasible. We should not create mutants that thetest suite would likely fail on or that give no actionable signal todevelopers.

We combinethe mutations with instrumentation that measures which tests exactly visitedthe mutated piece of code. Results on more than 15,000 generated mutants showthat more than half of the generated mutants survive Facebook's rigorous testsuite of unit, integration, and system tests. Moreover, in a case study with 26developers, all but two found information of automatically detected test holesinteresting in principle.

We propose a mutation testing approach that leverages fuzz testing, which hasproved effective with C and C++ software. Fuzz testing automatically generatesdiverse test inputs that exercise program branches in a varied number of waysand, therefore, exercise statements in different program states, thusmaximizing the likelihood of killing mutants, our objective.  We performed an empirical assessment of our approach with software componentsused in satellite systems currently in orbit. Our empirical evaluation showsthat mutation testing based on fuzz testing kills a significantly higherproportion of live mutants than symbolic execution (i.e., up to an additional47 percentage points).

Many systems arecalled to operate in uncertain and highly-changing environment, not rarelyrequired to make intelligent decisions by themselves. This easily results in anintractable state space to explore at testing time. The state-of-the-arttechniques try to keep the pace, e.g., by augmenting the tester's intuitionwith some form of (explicit or implicit) learning from observations to searchthis space efficiently. For instance, they exploit historical data to drive thesearch (e.g., ML-driven testing) or the tests execution data itself (e.g.,adaptive or search-based testing). Despite the indubitable advances, the needfor smartening the search in such a huge space keeps to be pressing.

We show that this type of few-shot learningcan be unstable: the choice of prompt format, training examples, and even theorder of the training examples can cause accuracy to vary from near chance tonear state-of-the-art. We demonstrate that this instability arises from thebias of language models towards predicting certain answers, e.g., those thatare placed near the end of the prompt or are common in the pre-training data.To mitigate this, we first estimate the model's bias towards each answer byasking for its prediction when given the training prompt and a content-freetest input such as ""N/A"". We then fit calibration parameters that cause theprediction for this input to be uniform across answers. On a diverse set oftasks, this contextual calibration procedure substantially improves GPT-3 andGPT-2's average accuracy (up to 30.0% absolute) and reduces variance acrossdifferent choices of the prompt.",Tony Z.

Motivated by the prompt learning in NLP, in this paper, wepropose to learn an image-level visual domain prompt for target domains whilehaving the source model parameters frozen. During testing, the changing targetdatasets can be adapted to the source model by reformulating the input datawith the learned visual prompts. Specifically, we devise two types of prompts,i.e., domains-specific prompts and domains-agnostic prompts, to extract currentdomain knowledge and maintain the domain-shared knowledge in the continualadaptation. Furthermore, we design a homeostasis-based prompt adaptationstrategy to suppress domain-sensitive parameters in domain-invariant prompts tolearn domain-shared knowledge more effectively. This transition from themodel-dependent paradigm to the model-free one enables us to bypass thecatastrophic forgetting and error accumulation problems.

Investigation into the trade-off between resource-intensivepost-compression re-training highlights the prospect of prompt-driven recoveryas a lightweight adaption tool. However, existing studies, confined mainly toperplexity evaluations and simple tasks, fail to offer unequivocal confidencein the scalability and generalizability of prompting. We tackle thisuncertainty in two key ways.

Second, we delve into a scientific understanding of why""prompting might be all you need post-LLM compression."" Our findings suggestthat compression does not irretrievably erase LLM model knowledge but displaceit, necessitating a new inference path.

To address this problem, we propose a new approach,adversarial specification mining, and develop a prototype, DICE (Diversitythrough Counter-Examples). DICE has two components: DICE-Tester and DICE-Miner.After mining Linear Temporal Logic specifications from an input test suite,DICE-Tester adversarially guides test generation, searching for counterexamplesto these specifications to invalidate spurious properties. Thesecounterexamples represent gaps in the diversity of the input test suite. Thisprocess produces execution traces of usage patterns that were unrepresented inthe input test suite.

When learning on new data is tooexpensive, it is possible to use \textit{Transfer Learning} to ""transfer"" oldlessons to the new context. Traditional transfer learning has a number ofchallenges, specifically, (a) learning from excessive data takes excessivetime, and (b) the performance of the models built via transfer can deteriorateas a result of learning from a poor source.

Thecoefficient B was suggested to be universal in the arguments of colour glasscondensate (CGC) of QCD in recent years. There has been, however, no rigorousproof yet based only on QCD. We attempt to investigate the value of B for pi+-p, K+- p and pbar p,pp scatterings respectively through the search for thesimultaneous best fit to the experimental sigma(tot) and rho ratios at highenergies. The sigma(tot) at the resonance and intermediate energy regions hasalso been exploited as a duality constraint based on the special form offinite-energy sum rule(FESR). We estimate the values of B, s0 and Zindividually for pi+- p, K+- p and pbar p,pp scatterings without using theuniversality hypothesis. It turs out that the values of B are mutuallyconsistent within one standard deviation. It has to be stressed that we cannotobtain such a definite conclusion without the duality constraint. It is alsointeresting to note that the values of Z for pi p, Kp and pbar(p)papproximately satisfy the ratio 2:2:3 predicted by the quark model. Theobtained value of B for pbar(p)p is Bpp = 0.280 +- 0.015 mb, which predictssigma(tot)(pp) =108.0 +- 1.9mb and rho(pp) =0.131+- 0.0025 at the LHC energys^0.5 =14 TeV.",Muneyuki Ishida,2009/3/11,2009/4/26

The ASACUSA hodoscope is a detector consisting of two layers of 32 plasticscintillator bars individually read out by two serially connected silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) on each end. Two additional layers for position resolutionalong the beam axis were scintillator fibres, which will now be replaced byscintillating tiles placed onto the existing bars and also read out by SiPMs.If the antiproton of antihydrogen annihilates in the center of the hodoscope,particles (mostly pions) are produced and travel through the various layers ofthe detector and produce signals.  The hodoscope was successfully used during the last data taking period atCERN. The necessary time resolution to discriminate between particlestravelling through the detector from outside and particles produced in thecenter of the detector was achieved by the use of waveform digitisers andsoftware constant fraction discrimination. The disadvantage of this readoutscheme was the slow readout speed, which was improved by two orders ofmagnitude. This was done by omitting the digitisers and replacing them withTDCs reading out the digital time-over-threshold (ToT) signal using leadingedge discrimination.",V. Kraxberger,2022/4/25,2022/10/24

The model includesthe effects of massive neutrinos, nonlinear matter clustering and nonlinear,scale-dependent galaxy bias in a self-consistent manner. We first test theaccuracy of PT-model by comparing the model predictions with the halo powerspectrum in real- and redshift-space measured from simulations without massiveneutrinos. We show that the PT-model with bias parameters being properlyadjusted can fairly well reproduce the simulation results. As a result thebest-fit parameters obtained from the hypothetical parameter fitting recover,within statistical uncertainties, the input cosmological parameters insimulations, including an upper bound on neutrino mass, if the power spectruminformation up to k~0.15h/Mpc is used. However, for the redshift-space powerspectrum, the best-fit cosmological parameters show a sizable bias from theinput values if using the information up to k~0.2h/Mpc, probably due tononlinear redshift distortion effect. Given these tests, we decided, as aconservative choice, to use the LRG power spectrum up to k=0.1h/Mpc in order tominimize possible unknown nonlinearity effects. In combination with the recentresults from Wilkinson Microwave Background Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), we derivea robust upper-bound on the sum of neutrino masses, given as m_nu,tot < 0.81eV(95% C.L.), marginalized over other parameters including nonlinear biasparameters and dark energy equation of state parameter.

We start by extracting adateset of 5,039 Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) removals from 595open-source projects. SATD refers to technical debt instances documented (e.g.,via code comments) by developers. We use this dataset to experiment with sevendifferent generative deep learning (DL) model configurations. Specifically, wecompare transformers pre-trained and fine-tuned with different combinations oftraining objectives, including the fixing of generic code changes, SATDremovals, and SATD-comment prompt tuning. Also, we investigate theapplicability in this context of a recently-available Large Language Model(LLM)-based chat bot. Results of our study indicate that the automatedrepayment of SATD is a challenging task, with the best model we experimentedwith able to automatically fix ~2% to 8% of test instances, depending on thenumber of attempts it is allowed to make. Given the limited size of thefine-tuning dataset (~5k instances), the model's pre-training plays afundamental role in boosting performance.

As in practice, thetraining cases have to be expensively hand-labeled by the user, we need anapproach to check the program behavior with a lower number of training cases.Metamorphic testing needs no labeled input/output examples. Instead, theprogram is executed multiple times, first on a given (randomly generated)input, followed by related inputs to check whether certain user-definedrelations between the observed outputs hold. In this work, we suggest MTGP,which combines metamorphic testing and genetic programming and study itsperformance and the generalizability of the generated programs.

Sosiefication generates sosieprograms, i.e., variants of a program in which some statements are deleted,added or replaced but still pass the test suite of the original program. Ourinvestigation of the influence of test suites on sosiefication exploits thefollowing observation: test suites cover the different regions of programs invery unequal ways. Hence, we hypothesize that sosie synthesis has differentperformances on a statement that is covered by one hundred test case and on astatement that is covered by a single test case. We synthesize 24583 sosies on6 popular open-source Java programs. Our results show that there are twodimensions for diversification. The first one lies in the specification: themore test cases cover a statement, the more difficult it is to synthesizesosies. Yet, to our surprise, we are also able to synthesize sosies on highlytested statements (up to 600 test cases), which indicates an intrinsic propertyof the programs we study. The second dimension is in the code: we manuallyexplore dozens of sosies and characterize new types of forgiving code regionsthat are prone to diversification.",Benoit Baudry,2015/9/1,2018/12/23

The idea is to synthesizetype-intensive but small and well-typed programs by leveraging and combiningapplication programming interfaces (APIs) derived from existing softwarelibraries. Our primary insight is backed up by real-world evidence: asignificant number of compiler typing bugs are caused by small test cases thatemploy APIs from the standard library of the language under test. This isattributed to the inherent complexity of the majority of these APIs, whichoften exercise a wide range of sophisticated type-related features. The maincontribution of our approach is the ability to produce small client programswith increased feature coverage, without bearing the burden of generating thecorresponding well-formed API definitions from scratch. To validate diverseaspects of static typing procedures (i.e., soundness, precision of typeinference), we also enrich our API-driven approach with fault-injection andsemantics-preserving modes, along with their corresponding test oracles.  We evaluate our implemented tool, Thalia on testing the static typingimplementations of the compilers for three popular languages, namely, Scala,Kotlin, and Groovy. Thalia has uncovered 84 typing bugs (77 confirmed and 22fixed), most of which are triggered by test cases featuring APIs that rely onparametric polymorphism, overloading, and higher-order functions.

However,we are aware of no research that offered a holistic view of the distribution ofthose ML quality assurance challenges across the various phases of softwaredevelopment life cycles (SDLC). This paper conducts an in-depth literaturereview of a large volume of research papers that focused on the qualityassurance of ML models. We developed a taxonomy of MLSA quality assuranceissues by mapping the various ML adoption challenges across different phases ofSDLC. We provide recommendations and research opportunities to improve SDLCpractices based on the taxonomy. This mapping can help prioritize qualityassurance efforts of MLSAs where the adoption of ML models can be consideredcrucial.",Md Abdullah Al Alamin,2021/5/3,2021/7/8

Nowadays, many softwarecompanies adopt an agile process and a shorter release cycle, where softwareneeds to be delivered faster with quality assurances.

In the popular versioncontrol systems such as git, the program changes are still presented usingsource code diffs. It is hard to understand what program conditions are changedand which source code lines cause them. In this paper, we propose to compute""invariant diffs"" to specify changes. Similar to source diffs that reportcommon code and code churns, we define version invariants to represent programconditions that are common across versions, and invariant churns to show thechanges of program conditions between versions. We designed a staticdemand-driven, path-sensitive analysis to compute and compare invariants formultiple versions of programs using multiversion control flow graphs. We reportinvariant diffs at the matched program points where comparing invariants aremeaningful. Importantly, our analysis correlates source diffs with invariantdiffs to explain what source code changes lead to the property changes. Weimplemented our algorithms in a tool called $H_2$ and performed experiments on104 versions of programs. Our results show that we are able to computeinvariant diffs correctly within reasonable amount of time. The versioninvariants can capture the common properties of program versions evenconstructed by different persons, and the invariant churns can specify thesemantics of changes such as how a patch changed a buggy condition to a correctcondition.",Ashwin Kallingal Joshy,2019/11/18,2020/6/30

In contrast, humans write messagesthat are short and summarize the high level rationale. In this paper, we adaptNeural Machine Translation (NMT) to automatically ""translate"" diffs into commitmessages.

Unfortunately, despitethe use of many software quality assurance (SQA) practices in softwaredevelopment (e.g., code review, continuous integration), defects may stillexist in the official release of a software product. Therefore, prioritizingSQA efforts for the vulnerable areas of the codebase is essential to ensure thehigh quality of a software release. Predicting software defects at the linelevel could help prioritize the SQA effort but is a highly challenging taskgiven that only ~3% of lines of a codebase could be defective. Existing workson line-level defect prediction often fall short and cannot fully leverage theline-level defect information. In this paper, we propose Bugsplorer, a noveldeep-learning technique for line-level defect prediction. It leverages ahierarchical structure of transformer models to represent two types of codeelements: code tokens and code lines. Unlike the existing techniques that areoptimized for file-level defect prediction, Bugsplorer is optimized for aline-level defect prediction objective. Our evaluation with five performancemetrics shows that Bugsplorer has a promising capability of predictingdefective lines with 26-72% better accuracy than that of the state-of-the-arttechnique. It can rank the first 20% defective lines within the top 1-3%suspicious lines.

1708.01419v1,DoKnowMe: Towards a Domain Knowledge-driven Methodology for Performance Evaluation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01419v1,"Software engineering considers performance evaluation to be one of the keyportions of software quality assurance. Unfortunately, there seems to be a lackof standard methodologies for performance evaluation even in the scope ofexperimental computer science. Inspired by the concept of ""instantiation"" inobject-oriented programming, we distinguish the generic performance evaluationlogic from the distributed and ad-hoc relevant studies, and develop an abstractevaluation methodology (by analogy of ""class"") we name Domain Knowledge-drivenMethodology (DoKnowMe). By replacing five predefined domain-specific knowledgeartefacts, DoKnowMe could be instantiated into specific methodologies (byanalogy of ""object"") to guide evaluators in performance evaluation of differentsoftware and even computing systems. We also propose a generic validationframework with four indicators (i.e.~usefulness, feasibility, effectiveness andrepeatability), and use it to validate DoKnowMe in the Cloud servicesevaluation domain. Given the positive and promising validation result, we planto integrate more common evaluation strategies to improve DoKnowMe and furtherfocus on the performance evaluation of Cloud autoscaler systems.",Zheng Li,2017/8/4,2017/8/4

2311.08328v1,A PRISMA-driven systematic mapping study on system assurance weakeners,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08328v1,"Context: An assurance case is a structured hierarchy of claims aiming atdemonstrating that a given mission-critical system supports specificrequirements (e.g., safety, security, privacy). The presence of assuranceweakeners (i.e., assurance deficits, logical fallacies) in assurance casesreflects insufficient evidence, knowledge, or gaps in reasoning. Theseweakeners can undermine confidence in assurance arguments, potentiallyhindering the verification of mission-critical system capabilities.  Objectives: As a stepping stone for future research on assurance weakeners,we aim to initiate the first comprehensive systematic mapping study on thissubject. Methods: We followed the well-established PRISMA 2020 and SEGRESSguidelines to conduct our systematic mapping study. We searched for primarystudies in five digital libraries and focused on the 2012-2023 publication yearrange. Our selection criteria focused on studies addressing assurance weakenersat the modeling level, resulting in the inclusion of 39 primary studies in oursystematic review.  Results: Our systematic mapping study reports a taxonomy (map) that providesa uniform categorization of assurance weakeners and approaches proposed tomanage them at the modeling level.  Conclusion: Our study findings suggest that the SACM (Structured AssuranceCase Metamodel) -- a standard specified by the OMG (Object Management Group) --may be the best specification to capture structured arguments and reason abouttheir potential assurance weakeners.",Kimya Khakzad Shahandashti,2023/11/14,2023/11/14
1903.01220v1,An Assurance Framework for Independent Co-assurance of Safety and Security,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01220v1,"Integrated safety and security assurance for complex systems is difficult formany technical and socio-technical reasons such as mismatched processes,inadequate information, differing use of language and philosophies, etc.. Manyco-assurance techniques rely on disregarding some of these challenges in orderto present a unified methodology. Even with this simplification, no methodologyhas been widely adopted primarily because this approach is unrealistic when metwith the complexity of real-world system development.  This paper presents an alternate approach by providing a Safety-SecurityAssurance Framework (SSAF) based on a core set of assurance principles. This isdone so that safety and security can be co-assured independently, as opposed tounified co-assurance which has been shown to have significant drawbacks. Thisalso allows for separate processes and expertise from practitioners in eachdomain. With this structure, the focus is shifted from simplified unificationto integration through exchanging the correct information at the right timeusing synchronisation activities.",Nikita Johnson,2019/1/24,2019/1/24
1611.08847v1,Rapid quality assurance with Requirements Smells,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08847v1,"Bad requirements quality can cause expensive consequences during the softwaredevelopment lifecycle, especially if iterations are long and feedback comeslate. %-- the faster a problem is found, the cheaper it is to fix. This makesexplicit the need of a lightweight detection mechanism of requirements qualityviolations. We aim at a light-weight static requirements analysis approach thatallows for rapid checks immediately when requirements are written down. Wetransfer the concept of code smells to Requirements Engineering as RequirementsSmells. To evaluate the benefits and limitations, we define RequirementsSmells, realize our concepts for a smell detection in a prototype called Smellaand apply Smella in a series of cases provided by three industrial and auniversity context. The automatic detection yields an average precision of 59%at an average recall of 82% with high variation. The evaluation in practicalenvironments indicates benefits such as an increase of the awareness of qualitydefects. Yet, some smells were not clearly distinguishable. Lightweight smelldetection can uncover many practically relevant requirements defects in areasonably precise way. Although some smells need to be defined more clearly,smell detection provides a helpful means to support quality assurance inRequirements Engineering, for instance, as a supplement to reviews.",H.

The present work aims to provide an overview of studies related totime pressure in software engineering; specifically, existing definitions,possible causes, and metrics relevant to time pressure were collected, and amapping of the studies to software processes and approaches was performed.Moreover, we synthesize results of existing quantitative studies on the effectsof time pressure on software development, and offer practical takeaways forpractitioners and researchers, based on empirical evidence. Our search strategyexamined 5,414 sources, found through repository searches and snowballing.Applying inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in the selection of 102papers, which made relevant contributions related to time pressure in softwareengineering. The majority of high quality studies report increased productivityand decreased quality under time pressure. Frequent categories of studies focuson quality assurance, cost estimation, and process simulation. It appears thattime pressure is usually caused by errors in cost estimation. The effect oftime pressure is most often identified during software quality assurance. Themajority of empirical studies report increased productivity under timepressure, while the most cost estimation and process simulation models assumethat compressing the schedule increases the total needed hours. We also findevidence of the mediating effect of knowledge on the effects of time pressure,and that tight deadlines impact tasks with an algorithmic nature more severely.Future research should better contextualize quantitative studies to account forthe existing conflicting results and to provide an understanding of situationswhen time pressure is either beneficial or harmful.",Miikka Kuutila,2019/1/17,2020/1/9
1604.05389v2,A Model-based Approach for Effective Service Delivery,http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05389v2,"With the prevalence of X-as-a-Service (e.g., software as a service, platformas a service, infrastructure as a service, etc.) and users' growing demand ongood services, QoS (Quality of Service) assurance is becoming increasinglyimportant to service delivery. Traditional service delivery mainly focuses onfunction or information provisioning, and does not give high priority toquality assurance. In this paper, we tackle the QoS assurance problem in asystematic way, from model to system. We first decompose traditional servicesinto three components - namely software application, data and resource, thendefine models for these three kinds of basic services, and propose a set ofoperations for service publishing and composition. To illustrate our approach,we present a prototype system, the Platform as a Service (PaaS) system, whichis developed in support of our framework and shows how QoS can be ensuredthrough real-time monitoring and dynamic scaling (up or down).",Feng-Lin Li,2016/4/19,2016/5/31

In emerging standardization andguidance efforts, there is a growing consensus in the value of using assurancecases for that purpose. This paper develops a quantitative notion of assurancethat an LES is dependable, as a core component of its assurance case, alsoextending our prior work that applied to ML components. Specifically, wecharacterize LES assurance in the form of assurance measures: a probabilisticquantification of confidence that an LES possesses system-level propertiesassociated with functional capabilities and dependability attributes. Weillustrate the utility of assurance measures by application to a real worldautonomous aviation system, also describing their role both in i) guidinghigh-level, runtime risk mitigation decisions and ii) as a core component ofthe associated dynamic assurance case.",Erfan Asaadi,2020/6/18,2020/6/18
